         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>Great care muſt be taken in the Caſting of Pieces of Ordnance, that they be equal every way in proportion of Metals, that is, that the Cylender be in the very middle of the Metal, that it may be truely bored, otherwiſe your Piece will fail the Artiſt that ſhall uſe it, until the error be known.</p>
                        <p>In the next place let the Trunions be exactly placed in a Diagonal line with the Axis of the Piece; and they may be placed in their proper diſtance from the Muzzle and Britch, if you obſerve theſe Rules. Take the length of the bore of the Piece from Muzzle to Britch, divide that meaſure by ſeven, and multiply that ſum that cometh of the Quotient by three, the Product will ſhew you how many inches the Trunions muſt ſtand from the loweſt part of the concavity of the Piece.</p>
                        <p>And farther note, that the Trunions ought to be placed ſo, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>When all additional Patterns, as Britch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be made and Luted in their proper place, all things at pleaſure being neatly added to the pattern, let the Mold then be fixt or placed ſo as is moſt convenient for the pouring in the Metal; ſo when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46160:4"/> the Metal is caſt, the perfect impreſſion will be made upon the ſuperficial part of the Piece, and the Cylender will keep the bore propoſed according to what you have preſcribed, the length of the Piece and its Diameter of the bore may be found by the following Table in the next Chapter. For the Metals generally uſed for thoſe Guns, generally called braſs Guns, they are mixtures, and many times varied as experience will give leave. Some of the chiefeſt do approve of this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, to every hundred Weight of Copper 24 pounds of Tin, and 6 pounds of Lattin. Others to <hi>100l.</hi> of Copper, add 8 <hi>l.</hi> of Tin, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> of Lattin. Others to ever <hi>100l.</hi> add <hi>20l.</hi> of Bell-Metal, which is <hi>25l.</hi> of Lead and Tin to every <hi>100l.</hi> of of Copper. Some add Tin, Lead, Copper, and <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> together; ſo every one follows ſuch wayes of Compoſition as doth moſt pleaſe his own Experience. The Copper and other better Metals being once melted, the Tin and Lead is added for the better and quicker fuſion; and the higher the Metal is in fuſion, the more ſolid and compact your Metal will run and ſettle. The Lattin doth incorporate and cauſe the Piece to be of a good colour, and the Tin doth ſtrengthen and bind the other matters together. Now a Piece of Ordnance being Caſt, before it comes to Service, it muſt be put to tryal; for which purpoſe there is uſed for proof, according to the weight of the ſhot, about two thirds, or four fifths of that weight in Powder, and for ſmaller Pieces more.</p>

                        <p>This done, he muſt faſten it with great diligence to the lower Truckle, by putting the Ears as through the Ring which is under the ſaid Truckle; after this begin to Hoyſe your Peice, and in the Hoyſing put a ſpar or ſome ſuch thing into the mouth of the Peice, ſo that thereby it may be governed, and may not ſway from one ſide to the other, which would be dangerous; for if it ſhould ſtrike againſt the Rouler or any one of the feet of the Gynne, it may break all, and ſo ſpoil both the work and the men tending upon it. Therefore I ſay, be ſure that thoſe who ſtand by the Spar be careful in guiding the Piece and keeping it ſteddy and right, until the weight of the Piece is well ſetled, a diligent Eye being had all this while, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feet of the Gynne, nor Rope give way; and be ſure every part of the Rope draw equal, and that there be no Knicks, or that they be not tangled one amongſt another; and for that purpoſe, when they begin to hoyſe the Piece, blows muſt be given upon the Tackling until it be ſet tort, and all bear equal.</p>
                        <p>But if you ſhould perceive that the Ghynne or any part give way, preſently let your Piece ſink, and underlay and ſettle well the feet of the Ghynne, and that as gently as may be, to the end the Croſs beam or Rouler may not be disjoyned or broken.</p>
                        <p>Then wind it up carefully and very gently by the help of two men onely, and in ſuch a manner, as when one of the Leavers is brought down, it muſt be held there faſt until the other has got purchaſe, and then muſt this other alſo be brought down; this muſt be reiterated ſo often until it be ſo high that the Carriage may be placed under it, ſo that the Trunions may fall into the Sockets, or holes of the Carriage, and then Guide the Piece by the Spar, ſo that it fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </argument>
                        <p>SEeing we have diſcovered the way of Caſting a Piece, and Mounting it in its Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, it follows in the next place that in this Chapter we treat of, and ſhew the manner of drawing them from place to place, for Service; where care muſt be taken what the way is that you are to paſs, for if the way be foul, mooriſh, and dirty, there is then required as many more Horſes as in good wayes. That is,</p>
                        <p>For a whole Cannon of 8000 <hi>l.</hi> you may uſe 15 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                        <p>For a Demi-Cannon of about 6000 <hi>l.</hi> you may uſe 11 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                        <p>For a Piece of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> weight, you may uſe 8 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                        <p>For a Field Piece of about 3000 <hi>l.</hi> uſe 6 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                        <p>For a Saker of 1800 <hi>l.</hi> weight, you may uſe 4 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                        <p>For a Piece of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> weight, you may uſe 3 couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar.</p>
                        <p>For a Faucon, two couple of Horſes, beſides the Tyllar. For a ſmall Drake of about 250 <hi>l.</hi> one Horſe will ſerve: and by the ſame Rule you may find how many Horſes will draw any weight whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>Many times when Horſes are wanting, men are made uſe of: Upon ſuch occaſions, you muſt divide your men into three drawing files, according to the greatneſs of the Piece; now to the end the Ranks may ſpread, and every man may draw equally alike, faſten to the end of the Carriage a Croſs beam or bar, to which you muſt faſten the drawing Ropes, equally at ſuch diſtance, that one may not impead the other, and let there be beſure one to ſteer the Piece when you come to any winding or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If the drawing Ropes be long, 'tis neceſſary to croſs it with Ropes, or ſome light peeces of wood like a Ladder, with two or more croſs peeces; let them be made faſt for the better and more ſteady drawing, and to every there muſt be a Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line faſtned to the Ropes, and ſo to caſt over every mans Sholders, in manner as is uſed to draw our Weſtern Barges: And you muſt know your proportion of men fit to draw any Piece of Ordnance, and that muſt be regulated according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or badneſs of the way, and ſo more or leſs men, allowing every man to draw about 50, 60, or 80 pounds; for 'tis ſuppoſed a man may draw in ordinary way 50 or 60 pounds but in very good way more than 80 pounds, however 'tis good to have men enough. Let the Spunge, Ladle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be made faſt along the Piece to the Ring and Britch end. Sometimes by reaſon of the unevenneſs, ſteepneſs, or other defects of the way, it ſometimes happens, that you may be forc'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount your Piece, and remount it again; there 'tis neceſſary every Gunner have with him a Ghynne, a Wynche, and all appurtenances neceſſary thereunto. As to the Sea Gunner on board Ship, their occaſions require no more than the Wynch; and their Piece being mounted according to the directions given in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then with one or two Tackles he bring the Piece to the place deſired, where it ought to be well faſtned in its place; for which purpoſe there is thereunto required Tack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But in caſe any thing ſhould give way in foul weather, then with all ſpeed diſmount the Piece as ſoon as poſſible you can, for fear of further miſchief; for which purpoſe put in his way as he runs from ſide to ſide, Rugs, Pillows, Beds, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and ſtand ready with Crows and Handſpikes, and with Tackles, to hitch or ketch him cloſe and faſt to any Ring by the Ship ſide, or ſuch other place as beſt preſents.

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT remains neceſſary for this Chapter to treat, or ſhew the way to know, whether a Piece be ſerviceable or no, which is uſually done in the firſt proof by Powder, which we intend not to Write of here, having mentioned it before, and more will be ſaid, when we have ſhewed the compoſition of Powder. That knowledge of a Piece we here intend, is to examine a Piece, bought, or to be taken into Service, whether good or ſerviceable, or out of many Pieces to make choice of the beſt, or ſuch as are freed from holes, flaws, cracks, honycombs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And firſt to know if a Piece be free from crack, or have holes through, take a long ſtick, longer than the Piece, made of a Hoop-ſtick or otherwiſe, ſlit it at one end, ſo that you may put a ſhort peece of Candle in it, then light the Candle, and put it into the Piece, and ſo putting it along eaſily, whilſt another laying his Eye cloſe to the Piece, do go along equally with the Candle, until the whole Piece be viewed, and ſo by help of the Light within ſide, the Eye without ſide will perceive whether there be any Flaws, Cracks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This may be done by the reflection of the Sun beams in at the Muzzle of a Piece, by help of a Looking-glaſs, or polliſhed Steel; but many times a Piece may be Flawed or Hony-combed, and cannot be diſcerned through the Piece, and then the beſt way to find them out is thus; make the uſual ſearch with two or three Springs, or in caſe you have them not, bend the Iron point of a Half Pike, then put it into the Piece up to the Britch end or bottom of the Cylinder, turning it round carefully and gradually, as you pluck it out, and if there be any Honey-combs, Cracks or Flawes, the end or bended point of the Half Pike wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To know whether the Piece be Chamber-bor'd, take a priming Iron that is ſmall, or a piece of Wire, bend it a little at the end, but ſo that it may go down at the Touch-hole, and put it down ſo far as it will go; Then at the Touch-hole cloſe by the Metal of the Piece, make a mark upon the Wire; then gently pluck it up upon one ſide of the Touch-hole, until the bended point ſtop upon the Metal or upper ſide of the Chamber; and then make another mark upon the Wyer, juſt by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46160:7"/> then draw out the Wyer, and the diſtance between theſe two marks, is the height of the Chamber or bore of the Piece at Britch: take the height of the bore at Muzzle, and if this height at Muzzle agree with that taken at the Britch of the Piece, then is the Piece full bored; but if they differ, ſo much as the difference is, ſheweth the tapering of the Piece, and according to this muſt your former be made for your Cartredges. There is another way to know whether a Piece be Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor'd, or Tapering by the diſparting of a Piece; which way we ſhall ſhew in its proper place, where we treat of diſparting a Piece of Ordnance.</p>
                        <p>Now although we have mentioned in the former Chapters the moſt uſual Pieces of Ordnance; yet, as I have ſaid, there are other Pieces which are longer, or ſhorter, which are uſed, and are generally called by the name of Baſtard Pieces, and they are diſtinguiſhed from the common Legitimate Pieces thus; The Legitimate Pieces have their due length of Chance, and are proportioned according to the true height of their bore. Baſtard Pieces are ſhorter Chaſes, ſuch as the proportion of their bore doth require, and are therefore called Cuts of the ſame nature of the Piece they agree with in the bore; as thoſe of Demi-Culverin bore, are called Demi-Culverin Cuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are alſo Pieces called Extraordinary, which are ſuch whoſe Chaces are longer than is uſually for that bore.</p>
                        <p>Now we have well and duely underſtood how, not only to make, but alſo to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and prove a Piece of Ordnance, in the next place ſhall follow their uſe, ſet down in due order: Wherein firſt 'tis neceſſary for us to treat of the nature of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and its various Compoſitions, with the Materials neceſſary thereunto, and afterward ſhew its uſe.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is believed by many in theſe latter times, that the Salt-Peter now in uſe, is not the Niter of the Ancients, but a new Invention uſed or found out for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Powder; And that theirs was only a Niter generated by nature, or that Salt that is coagulated of it ſelf, without any humane Artifice, in the Caverns of the Earth, from whence they took it which nevertheleſs they divide into four different Species, to wit, <hi>Armenian, Affrican, Roman,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian;</hi> and this <hi>Egyptian</hi> holds its name by a certain Region in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which is found great abundance. <hi>Serapian</hi> delivers to us, that the places from whence they drew their Niter were all one and the ſame, like them where common Salt is formed, in which the water running doth congeal, and condenſeth like a vulgar Stone, from hence came it to be called ſtonified Salt, or Sal-Peter. The ſame Author doth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>irm, that Niter was found of divers colours, <hi>viz.</hi> White, Reddiſh, Livid, or Lead-like, and all other colours it was able to take; he ſaith likewiſe that it was found in different forms; for ſome was found full of holes or caverns like a Spunge; others on the contrary were firm, cloſe, ſollid, ſhining, and Diaphanous as Glaſs, which being let fall eaſily will ſplit in thin leaves, and is fryable in beating; and from its various appearances is judged its manifold vertues, in one more powerful than another, which is known by its operation.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46160:8"/>
                        <p>From hence we ſee that which is to be found from the teſtimony of the beſt received Authors about the Mineral Niter, and in none is any mention made of Artificial Salt-Peter, or ſuch as we at preſent make uſe of generally, which is called properly <hi>Salt-Peter, Sal Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Halinitre;</hi> yet is there very little difference between the Natural that uſeth to be brought to us, and the Artificial; for if we compare the vertues and operations of the one, we ſhall find them in our uſes no way d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ffering, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> teſtifies, ſaying that the ancient Niter is not much different from ours, particularly if we conſider its tenuity and ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>il part.</p>
                        <p>There is of the ancient Niter found upon the ſuperficies of old Walls, expoſed to the humidity; but particularly in Cellars and deep Caves, and in covered Vaults; it reſembles perfectly a certain Brine, or white Gelly, or fine Meal, or in more proper ſpeaking, fine Sugar, and is many times white as Snow; and this thus had, the vertues are to be commended, which I my ſelf have taken the pains to collect, in the imitation of many others which I have often ſeen; which if now it be deſired to prepare this Salt according to the method of our Art; It will be congealed into ſmall little long Chriſtals like Iſicles, and it will be like that of the Ancients. But as 'tis impoſſible to find ſo great a quantity, as the continual uſe doth conſume, and neceſſity doth excite to this day for the ſupply of all Wars, which have been great, and in few years conſumed many great and vaſt places of the Univerſe: We are therefore conſtrained to this new ſubject, and are forced even to ſtudy and invent in theſe latter ages a new way to ſupply the want of the former, which being made with much labour and induſtry from the bowels of the Earth, and then purified and waſhed divers times to ſeparate it from its more groſs and Terreſtrial parts, and taken from its firſt crudity, that its may ſhew its likeneſs of its Mother, it is in the end perfectly purified and brought to ſuch a height, that it differs nothing to he of the ſame form and vertue of the ancient Salt-Peter.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore if I may be admitted to ſpeak my thoughts upon it, I ſhall ſay openly and plainly, leaving none in doubt, the Ancients did indeed find natural growing Niter, which came out of it ſelf at the tops of Rocks, filling the clefts and holes, and there condenſing into ſmall Icicles, it hardnes and petrefies. This Niter is natural; but ſince Art is the Imitator of Nature, as 'tis allowed by all, then you may not think it ſtrange, if we can by a little of her aid, and by force of induſtry, attain to the perfection of her productions; nay, (if I may be bold to ſay it) ſuch as ſhall ſurpaſs by far, the more perfect of her works. Do we not daily ſee an infinite of very principal Works brought to light, after a long and painful travel, which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nature to imitate, although ſhe did imploy at the beſt all her ſecret and full ſtrength to come to perfection. It may from hence <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>herefore be concluded that our Salt made by the Art of Fire, is ſuch as is every way agreeing with that of the Ancients, not any way differing one from the other; eſpecially as to thoſe uſes we intend here. For if according to our method given in the next Chapter, I dare affirm, in all our uſes it will truely imitate the natural, but the more, if it be purified and purged many times: So that at laſt it will come to be more excellent than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and natural Salt-Peter; which is plainly ſeen in the ordinary way of purifying Common Salt or Sugar, which by Art is ſo purged, that it comes to be far purer and whiter than 'twas before, in its firſt natural dreſs. And this we do ſuppoſe to be a ſufficient argument, or reaſon, for us to judge that our Artificial Salt-Peter is not only as good, but far more excellent than the natural: Which being thus allowed, we will add only a few words of the properties of Niter, and ſo paſs to its Artificial preparation. And firſt of the ſpetting quality and noiſe it makes in the fire, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> would have to be cauſed by its terreſtrity that it holds in it ſelf, which we cannot allow of, but rather judge otherwiſe; for if the Earthy part were the ſubject that made it make ſuch noiſe, then the Earth it ſelf might be adjudged to make a far greater noiſe, ſeeing it is alſo mixed with this Element, and yet we find it cracks not at all, being put in the fire; therefore by conſequence this reaſon is void. Well then, is it of its rarity, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>, This cannot paſs for a truth, ſince daily experience doth let us ſee that the Muſhrooms,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46160:8"/> or Toad-ſtools, and many other things which are of a moſt rare thin nature, yet make no noiſe when put upon burning coals. Neither is the hardneſs that is joyned to theſe more ſubtil parts, the cauſe of the cracking; For we ſee that the Pumice-ſtone will not ſpet nor crack, nor make any noiſe in the fire, although it be of a ſubſtance ſufficiently ſpungy and hard. There muſt therefore be another thing that muſt be the cauſe of this ſpetting, and all the noiſe that is made by Nitre, when it is embraced by the fire. The Divine <hi>Praeceptor,</hi> in the 11 Section of his Queſtions ſaith, that the Salt cracks in the fire, becauſe it contains in it much moiſture, which being attenuated by the fire, and rarified in a high degree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts all into Spirits, and an Airy nature; For in it there is contained more of a Spirit, than watery matter, which being brought to the fire, the two fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits mutually attract each other, and joyning together, do become Maſter of the leſſer part the Water; for the fire of the Niter being fortified and put into action by the common fire, the Water is conſtrained from its bonds, and can ſtay no longer there, but muſt of a ſuddain depart, and in its way, by the violency of its departure, overthroweth all ſuch obſtacles as come in its way: And in this action the external air being ſtrongly and violently agitated, by their refraction, it breaks with impetuoſity or great violence, and from thence by conſequence follows that hideous and fearful noiſe which commonly and ordinarily happens, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion of Salt-Peter, and other Compoſitions mixed with it, whereof Salt-Peter is the greateſt part.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THe Earth and matter of Salt-Peter is found commonly in great abundance, in obſcure ſhadowed places, where no Rain nor any freſh water doth penitrate, nor likewiſe where the Sun by his rayes can communicate his heat; it is likewiſe drawn from Horſe dung under Stables, and from covered places where great and ſmall Cattle are ſhut up; likewiſe in ſuch places as men uſe to piſs in, or Jaqueſes, or the like places; or in places where has been made great Fights, or where has been laid up together many dead Bodies, and earth thrown upon them: For from thence in few years may much Salt-Peter be drawn. I ſhall declare three ſeveral wayes whereby to ground your judgment with more certaint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, concerning the goodneſs of the place from whence one would draw the Salt-Peter, which is moſt neceſſary to be known by all Salt-Peter men, or ſuch as intend to mannage theſe Affairs.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, that ſuch Earth as you ſuſpect to hold Salt-Peter, be put upon the Tongue, and if it prick a little ſharply, it is a moſt certain ſign you will not looſe your labour in taking it to task; but on the contrary if it be not biting, or a little corroſive, it will not well anſwer your money and labour in preparing of it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond way to know a good Nitrous Earth is this: make a hole in the Earth with a ſharp pointed thing, either of Wood or Iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in it put a peece of Iron red hot; after having ſtopt the hole, let it ſtand until it be quite cold, then draw it out, and if you find a little after about this Iron ſome Citrine marks, inclining a little after to a whiteneſs, you need not doubt that earth; but further aſſure your ſelf 'tis very good to put to work.</p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46160:9"/>
                        <p>The third way is, throw a little of that Earth upon burning Coals, and if you perceive it make any noiſe, and that it ſpets in the fire, or that clear and ſhining ſparks come from it, you may from thence judge that that Earth holds a forcible matter of that nature.</p>
                        <p>After you have found a proper Earth to draw Salt-Peter from, and that by ſome of theſe proofs you have teſtimony of its goodneſs and worth, let be taken of it a great quantity, or as much as you pleaſe; let it be carried to a place appointed for this purpoſe, then prepare to burn a good quantity of Wood, either of Oak, Aſh, Elm, Maple, or other ſorts of hard Wood, that you may have Aſhes; then take two parts of theſe Aſhes, one part of quick Lime, mix them well, and put this mixture by it ſelf; for ſuch uſes as I ſhall ſhew you anon.</p>
                        <p>Take then Veſſels of Wood, or Pipes, or Hogſheads cut in two parts, for they muſt be able to hold a good quantity of Water, make a hole at the bottom about one or two fingers breadth, put into the hole a ſmall wicker thing, or you may whelm over it an Earthen Diſh, after put Ruſhes all over the bottom (not excepting the hole) or in its place clean ſtraw; this Veſſel being thus fitted, diſpoſe of it in this manner; Set it ſo, that under may ſtand a leſſer Veſſel of Wood to receive the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that ſhall diſtil down from the upper Veſſel; after put into the upper Veſſel about the height of a hand of this Salt-Peter Earth, which has been before for ſome time dryed in the Air; upon this Earth put the height of three or four fingers of the mixture made of Aſhes and quick Lime, and then again of the Salt-Peter Earth, after of the Aſhes about the ſame height as before; and continue this faſhion, putting Earth upon Aſhes, and Aſhes upon Earth, until the Veſſel be full within a hands breadth at the top, to hold the Water that is put in; this done put upon it freſh Water as much as ſhall be neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo much as muſt ſurmount the Earth two or three fingers breadth, and look that it paſs through all the Earth, and run drop by drop through the hole at bottom of the Veſſel into the Tub ſtanding under, and you ſhall have a Nitrous <hi>Lixivium,</hi> according to the quantity of Water as you poured into the Veſſel; which if you judge is too little, you muſt reiterate the infuſion, and the ſecond time alſo the water paſſing through the Earth will carry with it a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; And ſo the third time.</p>
                        <p>This done, put all the <hi>Lixivium</hi> into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ettle of a ſufficient bigneſs, and let it be boyled upon the fire very eaſily, and moderately at firſt; after increaſe the fire to the conſumption of the Liquor, or a little more, keeping continually skimming it all the time it boyls. And when 'tis thus conſumed, pour it into wooden Veſſels that are broad, and cover them over with Cloaths, and let them ſtand until the pure part Chriſtalize into white Salt, and the feculent or more terreſtial part ſettle to the bottom. In the mean time continue pouring in of the <hi>Lixivium</hi> again into the Kettle, boyling and skimming it as before; and this do until all your <hi>Lixivium</hi> be boyled up and poured into wooden Veſſels to Chriſtalize.</p>
                        <p>Then from the wooden Veſſels, inclining them gently, pour all the <hi>Lixivium</hi> (leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſettling at bottom by it ſelf) into your Copper as before, and boyl it up again with a good fire until half be conſumed, or until it begin to thicken, or until by putting a little upon a ſtone or peece of board, it do immediately congeal.</p>
                        <p>Then take it from the fire, and when 'tis a little cooled, pour it as before into wooden Veſſels or Boles, and put into each about a hand in height; then cover each Veſſel with courſe cloaths, put it into a cool place, and two or three dayes after you will find your Salt-Peter congealed and thruſt together in ſmall Chriſtals, like tranſparent Ice, ſticking to the ſides of the Veſſel, and likewiſe upon ſome ſticks for that purpoſe, provided the rinds being taken off and placed in the wooden Veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pouring in of the Liquor; get diligently together the Peter, as well that which ſticks to the ſides of the Veſſel, as that to the ſticks, in a Veſſel of wood proper to receive it, and cover it, and keep it dry. The remaining water you muſt boyl up as before, not forgetting to ſeparate it from its reſidence.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt 'tis boyling, it happens ſometimes that the Liquor may riſe and boyl over the Cauldron; to prevent that danger, have in readineſs other <hi>Lixivium,</hi> made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46160:9"/> of three parts of Aſhes, and one part of quick Lyme, as we ſpoke before, in which is diſſolved <hi>Roch Allum,</hi> allowing to every hundred weight of <hi>Lixivium,</hi> four pounds of Allum; and when it begins to riſe, pour in a little of this from time to time; And by this means you will ſee that the water that was haſtning to come over, will fall down; and that the common Salt and more terreſtrial part will ſettle to the bottom.</p>
                        <p>The Earth remaining in the Wooden Tubs from whence the ſalt was drawn, muſt be put in ſome cover'd place made for that purpoſe, where neither Sun, Rain, nor any other water may come; and there it muſt be ſpread all abroad about a foot high: Then you muſt have in readineſs Horſe dung or the Excrements of all ſorts of Beaſts, great and ſmall, and put off this upon the other, about the height of three or four foot; then take all that was skum'd from the <hi>Lixivium</hi> in boyling, and the water that is left and will not ſhoot, and the bottoms that are left in the wooden Veſſel, where the Salt-Peter did ſhoot, and throw them away, as hurtful and uſeleſs, upon the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil; throw likewiſe every day, or as often as you can, the Urine of men, and let it lye two years, and you ſhall have your Earth filled with Salt-Peter as before, with a greater aboundance: You may likewiſe throw upon your Dunghill, the Horns, Claws, and Hoofs of Beaſt, and then from this Earth it will be very eaſie to draw good Salt-Peter by the method we have preſcribed.</p>

The order and method that ought to be uſed in this, is thus; in Veſſels of Iron or Copper, melt your Sulphur with a very gentle fire over Coals, well lighted, and not flaming; and when it is melted with a Ladle, skim neatly off all that riſeth on the top and ſwimmeth upon the Sulphur; then not long after, let it be taken from the fire, and ſtrained through a double Linnen Cloath into another Veſſel, pouring it through at leiſure; thus all the Oylie matter and craſſy ſubſtance remains in the Cloath; but under in the Veſſel will be a pure Sulphur, ſuch as we have before ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>To know the goodneſs of Sulphur you muſt do thus: Preſs it between two Iron plates, that are hot, and if in the running it appear yellow, without any bad odour, and that which remains be of a reddiſh colour, one may believe 'tis natural and excellent; ſo likewiſe 'tis a good ſign, if when 'tis ſet on fire, it do freely burn all away, leaving little or no reſident matter. For if Sulphur be pure and good, we do find that there is ſuch a ſympathy between it and fire, that the fire is deſirous of the Sulphur for its nutriment, and that reciprocally the Sulphur is pleaſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be thus devoured and conſumed by the Element of fire; ſo that if ſome fragment of it be put about ſome pieces of Wood, if this ſhall feel the fire at ſome diſtance, it ſeems as if it did attract it to it ſelf, and doth ſometimes unawares at a diſtance catch or take fire, if great care be not taken.</p>
                        <p>There is a certain kind of Sulphur which will not burn ſo freely as other Sulphur, nor ſend forth any ill ſcent, but being put upon the fire, melts no otherwiſe than common Wax; and this Sulphur is found abundantly near Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> as <hi>Carniola</hi> of <hi>Libavius</hi> reports, in his firſt Book of the <hi>Apocap. Hermel.</hi> but this Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is commonly red, as alſo is that which is found in the <hi>Heil des Heim</hi> (as <hi>Agricola</hi> mentions in his firſt Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.) And upon the teſtimony of <hi>Iohn Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Adm. Nat. Claſ. 4. Chap.</hi> 13. Sulphur is found likewiſe of divers other colours, as pale, Yellow, Green, as is many times to be ſeen and found ſticking about Stones and Rocks: So, that a man may, without any great difficulty, take it from thence, and make it into a Maſs.</p>
                        <p>That which is clear, perfectly yellow, not very hard, nor too much ſhining, is the very beſt. Yet there is another Sulphur which looks greeniſh, and hath never paſt the fire; and this is called <hi>Sulphur Vivum,</hi> and by ſome <hi>Virgin Sulphur,</hi> by reaſon Women and Maids had a cuſtom to compoſe with it a certain <hi>fucus</hi> or Paint, with which they uſed to adorn their faces.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THe wayes of Compounding of Gun-Powder have been ſo commonly known, that not only ſuch as are converſant in fireworks do underſtand the ſame, but others alſo; ſo that it is made a particular Trade: nay, that which is more ſtrange, the Countrey people in <hi>Polonia</hi> have learned to prepare it with their own hands, without the uſe of any Artificial Engine, or Chymical Veſſel. For I have ſeen many of the People of <hi>Podolie,</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krains,</hi> which we call now the <hi>Coſſaques,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Powder quite contrary to the common way, or that which is uſed by Fire-Maſters. For they put Sulphur, Salt-Peter, Charcoal, all together in an Earthen Pot, a certain proportion of each; (which proportion one to the other they have learned by experimental practice) upon which they pour fair freſh water, which they boyl upon the fire until all the water is evaporated, and the matter become thick; then
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46160:12"/> they take it from the fire, and dry it in the Sun, or in ſome warm place, as a Stove, or the like; then they paſs it through a Hair Sieve, and reduce it into ſmall Grains. There are others that take theſe Materials, and grind them upon a ſmooth flat Stone, or a ſmooth Earthen Diſh, and then having moiſtned it, by their Skill they bring it into Grains; which powder brought to this degree of perfection, they ſerve their occaſions with as much utillity and profit, as if it had been made by the hand of one of the moſt knowing or skilful Powder-makers in the world.</p>
                        <p>It is in my judgment, labour loſt to ſpeak more of theſe ſuperficial wayes; but come to the order and method which is neceſſary and uſually obſerved in the preparing of Gun-Powder: It ſhall likewiſe ſuffice me to propoſe in this Chapter ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions moſt excellent and beſt approved; which are theſe,</p>

                        <p>A Liquor for this purpoſe may likewiſe be made of twenty parts of <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and 12 parts of diſtilled Vinegar made of Whitewine, and four parts of Spirit of Salt-Peter, and two parts of water of Sal-armoniac, and one part of Camphire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Brandy-wine, or reduced into Powder with powdered Sulphur, or redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Oyl of ſweet Almonds.</p>

                        <p>It is obſerved by Fire-Maſters and Gunners, that Powder when it is Corned, is of much greater force and power, than in Meal; from hence 'tis concluded, that powder when 'tis put into a Piece of Ordnance, ought not to be preſſed or beaten home too hard in the Piece; for thereby it will looſe its form of grains, and thereby looſeth a great part of its ſtrength that it had, and is therefore not able to throw out the Bullet with ſo great a violence, as if the Powder had been gently thruſt home to the Britchend.</p>

For if inſtead of Coal you take rotten dryed wood, or Sawduſt well dryed, or white paper moiſtned and dryed in a Stove and powdered, or indeed any other thing of a combuſtible nature, or that is well diſpoſed to take fire (ſuch as you read hereunder) and to this you may add a colour according to your fancie and pleaſure; and you will infallibly have a Powder that will make the ſame Effect as the black powder.

                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is accuſtomary for men skilled in theſe Arts, to try Powder three ſeveral wayes; that is, by ſight, by touch, and by fire: And firſt, for the tryal by ſight; it is thus,</p>
                        <p>If the Powder be too black, it is a manifeſt ſign of too much humidity, or too much coal; now if it contain too much, as you ſuppoſe, rub it upon white Paper; if it black the Paper more than other good Powder uſe to do, it is a ſign there is more coal in it than ought: for ſuch Gun-Powder as is of a fair azure colour, or a little obſcure, ſomthing bordering upon red, is the beſt ſign, and the moſt aſſured teſtimony of good Powder.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Gun-Powder its goodneſs is known by the touch, in this manner, cruſh ſome Corns under your fingers ends, and if they eaſily break and return to Meal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſting the touch, or without feeling hard, you may aſſure your ſelf from thence, that your Powder hath in it too much Coal.</p>
                        <p>If by preſſing it a little hard under your fingers upon a ſmooth hard board, or upon a ſtone, you feel amongſt it ſmall grains harder or more ſollid than the reſt, which do in a manner prick the ends of the fingers, and do not yield to the finger but very difficultly, or hardly, you may infer from hence that the Sulphur is not well incorporated with the Salt-Peter, and by conſequence the Powder is not well and duely prepared.</p>
                        <p>You may draw infallible proofs or conjectures of the goodneſs of Powder by its burning, if after you have made little heaps of Powder upon a clean and even Table, diſtant one from another about a hands breadth, you then put fire to one of them only; and if it take fire alone, and burn all away without lighting the others, and make a ſmall thundring noiſe, or make a white clear ſmoak, and that it riſe with a quickneſs, ſuddainly, almoſt imperceptible, and if it riſe in the Air like a circle of ſmoak, or like a ſmall Crown; this is an infallible ſign the Powder is good, and perfectly well prepared.</p>
                        <p>If after the burning of the Powder there remain ſome black marks upon the Table, this then ſignifies that the Powder contains too much Coal, which has not been enough burnt.</p>
                        <p>If the board looks greaſie, then the Sulphur and Salt-Peter is not enough cleanſed, and by conſequence it retains much of their terreſtrial matter and oyly natures which were naturally conjoyned to their matters. If you find ſmall grains, white and Citrine, it is a teſtimony that the Salt-Peter is not enough cleanſed, and by conſequence it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46160:14"/> retains much of its terreſtrial matter, and of common Salt, and beſides, the Sulphur hath not been well powdered, nor ſufficiently incorporated with the two other matters of its Compoſition.</p>
                        <p>If two or three Corns of Gun-Powder be laid upon a Paper, diſtant about a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bredth one from the other, and you put fire to them, if the fire be good and ſtrong, they will fire at once, and there will remain no groſsneſs of Brimſtone, or of Salt-Peter, nor any thing but a white ſmoaky colour in the place where they were burnt, nor will the Paper be touched. If ſmall black knots, which will burn downward in the place where proof is made, remain after firing, they do ſhew that the Gun-powder hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> enough of Peter, and that it is of little force or ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>Good Gun-Powder will not burn your hand, if it be ſet on fire there.</p>
                        <p>Gun-Powder that is very ſharp or eager in taſt, is not well purified, and will turn moiſt.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt many ſorts of Powder, to know the beſt, make a little heap of every ſort at a diſtance one from another; obſerving well when you fire each heap, which of them doth ſooneſt take fire, for that which ſooneſt takes fire, ſmoaks leaſt and cleareſt, and riſeth quickly up cloſe and round, and leaves little or no ſign behind it, is the beſt Powder.</p>
                        <p>There are Inſtruments likewiſe invented for the tryal or proof of Powder, which the moſt part of Fire-Maſters and Gunners are accuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>If for the reaſons afore ſaid you deſire to repair and reſtore the ſtrength of Gun-Powder that begins to alter, or that hath quite loſt its force, its defects may be amended three ſeveral wayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz.</p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46160:14"/>
                        <p>The firſt is thus, make a Lye of two parts of <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and one part of clarified Salt-Peter made into fine Powder, of good Vinegar made of good Wine half a part, of Oyl of Sulphur one eighth part, and as much Camphire diſſolved in Brandy; theſe put together, do make a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which muſt be ſtrained through a large Strainer, and then with it you may amend your powder that is decayed, by moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it with the ſame, very often, and drying it by the Sun in Wooden Veſſels, and then putting it up in a dry place, free from any humidity or air, and then it will not in a long time again be damnified.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond way to repair Powder is thus, examine how much your Powder weighed when it was firſt put into the Cask or Barrel, then ſee how much it doth now weigh after 'tis damnified (it being firſt dryed if it chance to be wet) then ſee the difference between theſe two weights, and add ſo much Salt-Peter to your decayed powder, mix it well, and make it up into Corns again, and preſerve it as before.</p>
                        <p>The third way to reſtore the ſtrength of Gun-Powder, is ſuch as is moſt plain and commonly uſed amongſt the Powder-men; they put upon a Sale-cloath or ſmooth place or board, a portion of damnified Powder, to which they add an equal weight of that which is new made, and then with their hand or wooden Shovel they mingle it well together; then they dry it in the Sun, and put it up into a Barrel again, and keep it in a dry and proper place.</p>
                        <p>Yet there is another way may be allowed, but this is almoſt the ſame with making new Powder, and it is thus; Take what quantity of decayed Powder you pleaſe, put it into Earthen or Wooden Veſſels, pour upon the ſame three times ſo much hot water, ſtir it well about, and when it begins to be cold, or hath ſtood one hour or two, ſtrain the water away, and to the feces put more water, ſtirring it well about, then let it ſtand and ſettle as before, and ſtrain it from the feces, this do a third time, and you will have drawn out all the Salt-Peter; put theſe waters in a clean Kettle, and boyl it away until ſo much be conſumed, as that a drop dropped upon a Stone or Iron do congeal, then pour it into ſome wooden Veſſel that it may congeal into Salt-Peter; and that water as remains, you muſt boyl up again as before; and if need be, you muſt in the boyling skum what riſeth on the top of the water. Having by this Art obtained the Salt-Peter out of the decayed Gun-Powder, you may according to the proportions given in the Compoſition of Powder, mix it with its remaining Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Coal, or freſh Sulphur and Coal, which is better; and after 'tis well mixed, Corn it according to the given Rules; then let it be well d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ved in a dry place from Air or any Moiſture.</p>
                        <p>Some do mend their Powder in this nature, they moiſten it with Vinegar or fair water, beat it fine, and ſift it and dry it, and to every pound of Powder they put one Ounce of Mealed Salt-Peter; then moiſten and mix them well, ſo that neither may be diſcerned one from the other, but that they be perfectly incorporated, which you may know by cutting the Maſs with a Knife, or breaking it: When it is well compounded, let it be Corned in manner as we have before preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>If your Compoſition of Powder be made up with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and ſo made up into great Balls, and well dryed in a Stove, or in the Sun, and put into glazed earthen Pots, and cloſe covered, you may keep it as long as you pleaſe, for age will not decay it.</p>
                        <p>There ought alwayes a care to be taken by Gunners or Fire-Maſters, or ſuch as have the charge of Gun-powder, to chuſe if they can ſuch places as are dry, and ſtand upon the beſt ground, free from dampneſs of the Air or any water poſſibly coming near. Every Gunner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to take care that his Barrel be turned upſide down, or any Carthredge ready filled; for if the Powder attract air, the Peter with the moiſture it hath attracted, will in time ſeperate from the other matters, and ſink to the bottom; ſo that the Powder in the upper part will looſe its ſtrength, which is prevented by turning and ſhaking them every fourteen dayes, and airing them at the Sun at convenient times. And as 'tis neceſſary a Gunner ſhould have Carthredges filled for preſent Service, thoſe ought alſo to be turned out and filled again every four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes more or leſs, as the Gunner in his judgment ſhall allow of.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>WE ought infallibly to believe that Gun-Powder was not found out caſually, or by fortune; but invented by a true knowledge, and by reaſonable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in Natural Philoſophy; conſidering that to this day no man hath oppoſed (notwithſtanding many perſons have made it their endeavour) or could find any other Materials like unto theſe, or of ſuch a nature, which being well united and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated together, they are able to produce a fire ſo vigorous, fearful, powerful, and above all, ſo inextinguiſhable that the whole Univerſal matter is conſumed in a moment; which is the more to be believed, ſince we make not much difficulty, particularly in this our Age wherein we live, to add many things to the invention of others, and that (as the Phyſitians ſay) all that had a beginning doth paſs from imperfection to perfection. We deſire therefore it may be permitted (ſince the Inventors have left us nothing in Writing) to propoſe here ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Speculative truths, drawn from Experiment, which have been made about the ſtrength, nature, effects, and Office of all the matters comprehended in the Compoſition of Gun-Powder, as well of the particulars, as all made up into one body. For I believe, that having inſinuated into a perfect knowledge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and the affections, as well ſpecificated as general, of all its Ingredients, no body more will fall into thoſe Errors which are too often committed in the Art of <hi>Pyrotechny.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We muſt therefore know, that Gun-powder was not without reaſon compoſed of theſe three materials, to wit, Salt-Pete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, Sulphur, and Coal, but to the end that one might remedy or ſupply the defaults of the others. And this is it which is eaſie to be comprehended in the effect of Sulphur; for this is naturally the very aliment of the fire, ſeeing it joyns with it ſo willingly and freely, and having once taken fire, is moſt difficult to put out, being no otherwiſe rightly than a flaming fire, or, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it better, a pure flame; and therefore hath an aptitude to enflame the Salt-Peter, by its activity, more than any other kind of fire. But as the Salt-Peter lighted doth go promptly into certain windy exhalations, it hath thereby ſuch a ſtrength in it, that it would by its ventoſity put out the flame which the Sulphur hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and by conſequence deny it ſelf of that which the Sulphur communicateth to it; hereby you may ſee, if one had made a ſimple compoſition of theſe two things only, that is, of Sulphur and Salt-Peter compounded well together, if fire were then applyed, they would in truth be ſuddenly enflamed, but they would ſoon after go out, that is, the fire will not continue to the Conflagration and Conſumption of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the reaſon whereof we have given a little before. It was therefore by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adjudged, that Coal well dryed and powdered, being adjoyned to theſe two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials in a certain proportion, was an excellent remedy for the ſupplying of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſeeing that Coal is of ſuch a property and of ſuch a nature, that if it be held to the fire, it will ſoon light and be reduced to a fire without any flame; And from hence it comes to paſs, that the more it is agitated by the Air, or by wind, the more the fire augments, and will not go out, but conſerve it ſelf until the matter that nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth it is totally conſumed; a little aſhes only excepted. From hence it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that a Compoſition made of theſe three Ingredients, ſuch as is our Gunpowder, will conceive fire, and will be conſerved, enflamed and conſumed unto the laſt Atome. For it is moſt certain, that if we approach fire with it, the Sulphur which the fire extreamly loves is ſoon taken with it, and holdeth the ſame and introduceth it, not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46160:15"/> only into the Salt-Peter, but the coal alſo at the ſame moment, without producing any flame. Now this fire (as we have ſaid before) cannot be ſuffocated by wind, but on the contrary is enflamed the more, and takes new ſtrength by the agitation of the Air. And as this Sulphur is a great neighbour of the fire either with or without flame, ſo it cannot hinder it from taking fire; and 'tis the flame of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>imſtone imbraces the Salt-Peter, and the Coal continues it. And by conſequence theſe three materials joyned together, and well incorporated, and then lighted, produceth a fire, until all its aliment and ſubſtance be univerſally conſumed and annihilated: Yet there muſt care be taken that none of theſe ſubſtances have any accidental defaults, either in humidity or diſproportion, either more or leſs. We will conclude then all that we have ſaid, that the true office of Sulphur in the Powder is to conceive the flame or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fire, and having received it, to communicate it to the other matters; and that the Coal hath a particular care to retain and conſume it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to hinder the fire (after it is once introduced by the Sulphur) from ſuffocating or going out by any windy Exhalation and great violence cauſed by the Salt-Peter; and laſtly, that the moſt notable and particular office of the Salt-Peter is to produce and cauſe a moſt vehement and powerful ventoſity or windy Exhalation. And in this which I have ſaid, lieth all the truth of the ſtrength, power and expulſive motion and activity of the Gun-powder; and by conſequence Salt-Peter alone is the firſt and principal cauſe of all the admirable and aſtoniſhing Effects produced by Gunpowder; and conſeqnent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the two other materials are alliated with the Salt-Peter for no other end than to make it break forth into fire and wind. For proof of this, if any one will make a Compoſition of Sulphur and Coal only, and with it charge a Piece of Ordnance, he will find that this will not move or thruſt out a Shot of Iron or any other metal; the reaſon of this weakneſs is eaſie to be underſtood by our foregoing diſcourſe, becauſe the violent expulſion depends abſolutely in the Salt-Peter, and in this only expulſive faculty, and not in any of the other matters. Yea I believe that one may prepare Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ithout Brimſtone or Coal, rather than without Salt-Peter; or that a man may without much difficulty prepare other matters, that the one may do the office of Sulphur in kindling the matter, and the other that of Coal in Conſerving it and keeping it without flame. But any other thing that hath ſuch hidden natural properties to cauſe ſuch a ventous Exhalation, ſo violent and capable to produce ſuch prodigious Effects, as Salt-Peter, may not be produced.</p>

Example. By the former Rule, or by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Cube of the pounds will be found to be 2, 08, and the Cube of 18 will be 2, 62, now multiply this laſt number by 4, and it makes 9, 48, which divided by 2, 08 will give in the quotient 5, 03 for the Diameter required.</p>

And divide the Diameter of a Shot that weighs juſt two pounds into ſeven equal parts, and eight ſuch parts will make the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds weight. And Divide the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds, into 10 equal parts, and 11 of ſuch parts will give a Shot of 4 pounds weight. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Shot of 4 pounds weight into 13 parts, and 14 ſuch parts will make a Shot of 5 pounds in weight. And divide the Diameter of a Shot of 5 pounds weight, into 16 equal parts, and 17 ſuch parts will make a Diameter of a ſhot that will weigh 6 pounds. And ſo dividing the Diameter of a ſhot 6 pounds weight into 19 equal parts, and 20 ſuch parts will make a Diameter of a ſhot that will weigh 7 pounds. Thus dividing each next Diameter into three equal parts more than the next leſs Diameter was divided into, and with one part added to the Diameter of a ſhot it will weigh juſt one pound more, and ſo may proceed infinitely.</p>

                           <p>This 52½ pounds is the weight of a Shot of Lead of 3 Inches and a half Diameter.</p>
                           <p>The proportion between Iron and Stone is as 3 to 8, ſo that a Shot of 12 pound of ſtone is as big, or the ſame in Diameter, as the like Shot of Iron that weighs 32 pounds; but ſome ſay the proportion between Marble and Iron is as 15 to 34.</p>

And becauſe it may ſomtimes happen by reaſon of the ſteepneſs, badneſs and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs of the way, you may be driven to diſmount and remount your Piece, e're you get up to the top of a Hill; therefore you muſt carry with you a Gynn and a Wynch, with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging; as wind Ropes, an Iron Goats-foot, with a Crow, Pins, Truckles, Pullies to help you at a dead lift.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>FOr the better expedition of this work we have in the former Table ſhewed the length and breadth of each Ladle, always remembring that you cut each Ladle ſomewhat longer, that is, allowing ſo much more as muſt be faſtned to the ſtaff, or ſo much as the ſtaff goes within the Plate.</p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:46160:27"/>
                        <p>The Buttons or heads of the Ladles muſt be near the height of the ſhot.</p>
                        <p>For Spunges, the bottoms and heads muſt be of ſoft wood, as Birch and Willow, and to be one Diameter and three quarters in length, and three quarters or very little leſs of the height covered with Sheeps skin, and nayled with Copper nayles, ſo that together they may fill the hollow of the Piece; Let the bottoms and heads of the Rammers be made of good hard wood, and the height, one Diameter of the Shot, and the length one third of the Diameter of the Shot.</p>
                        <p>To make Ladles for Chamber bor'd Pieces, open your Compaſſes to the juſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the Chamber within one eighth part of an Inch, Divide that meaſure in two equal parts, then ſet the meaſure to one of them, and by that diſtance upon a flat or paper draw a Circle, the Diameter of that Circle is one fourth part ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Diameter of the Chamber; Take three fifths of that Circle for the breadth of the Plate of the Ladle. But for Cannon, the length ought to be twice and two third parts, to hold at twice the juſt Diameter of the Powder. As for Example,</p>
                        <p>The Diameter of a Circle drawn for a Cannon whoſe Chamber bore is 7 Inches, containeth ſix and three quarters, the circumference whereof is 21 Inches 6/7, and three fourth parts thereof is 12 ¾, and ſo much ought the Ladle to be in breadth, and in length 18 ⅔ parts. By this Rule you may make a Ladle for any Taper'd Piece.</p>
                        <p>Take notice for a general obſervation, that a Ladle 9 balls in length, and two balls in breadth, will near contain the juſt weight in Powder, that the Iron Shot for any piece weigheth.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, for Cartredges, they are generally made of paper Royal or Canvas. Take the height of the bore of your piece without the vent of the Shot, and cut the cloath or paper of 3 ſuch heights, for the Cannon in length 3 Diameters, for the Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin 4 Diameters, for the Saker and Faulcon <hi>&amp;c.</hi> half of the height of their proper bores, and leaving in the midſt at the top or bottome one other ſuch height, to make a bottom for the Cartredge, cutting each ſide ſomthing larger for Sewing, glewing, or paſting them together; you muſt have a great care to augment the goodneſs of your powder, and likewiſe the heating of your Piece, and ſo augment or diminiſh the quantity of Powder.</p>
                        <p>Let your Former be made to your Ordnance to the height of your Shot, and a convenient length longer than the Cartredge ought to be, and tallow it over firſt that the paper may ſlip off, and then put your paper on your Former. If you make your Cartredge of Canvas, half a Diameter more is allowed for ſeams, but if you make it of paper, half or three quarters of an Inch over-plus for paſting will ſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lapt once about the Former; having the bottom fitted upon the end of the Former, which muſt be hard and cloſe paſted by the lower ſide of the Cartredge, then let the lower end of the Cartredge be paſted down hard round about the bottom, and let them be well dryed before you fill them, and mark them how high they muſt be filled.</p>
                        <p>And if you have no Scales nor weights by you for Cannons, put two Diameters and a half for the height the powder muſt come, for Culverin 3 Diameters, for Saker 3 and a half Diameters, for leſſer Pieces four Diameters of the Cylinder.</p>
                        <p>For Carriages of Pieces of Ordnance for Land ſervice the Rules are given thus one and a half the length of the Cylender is the length of the Carriage, and in depth four Diameters of the bore of the Piece at the fore end, in the middle three and a half, and at the end next the ground two and a half, let the thickneſs be the Diameter of the Shot, the wheels ſhould be one half of the length of the Piece in height, but for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Minion you muſt exceed the former proportion by one twelfth part, the Faulcon and Faulconet by the ſixth part.</p>
                        <p>The Naves, the Cheeks called Limbres, and wheels, are uſually made of Elm, but the Tranſoms, Axeltreces, Fore-Carriage and Croſs beams, are made of Oaken Timber.</p>
                        <p>For drawing of Guns by men in caſe horſes be wanting, there is uſually allowed to every ſixty, eighty, or a hundred weight of metal to one man, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ground whereon they are to be drawn.</p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:46160:27"/>
                        <p>As for Sea Carriages, they are ſo well known to every Carriage-maker that they need not to be ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>As for fitting Shot to each Piece, it is the opinion of moſt Gunners, that every Piece of Ordnance ought to have its Shot within one quarter of an Inch of the Diameter of the bore; others do ſay, that the one and twentieth part of the Diameter of the Piece's Cylender is more proper and correſpondent for all ſorts of Pieces whatſoever; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may make choice of that which by experience he finds beſt.</p>

                              <hi>How a Gunner ought to charge a Piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving ſhewed the compleat making of Pieces of Ordnance, and the preparing of powder and Shot, with the due allowance of powder fit for every Gun, with all the Inſtruments and Materials neceſſarily belonging to a Piece, as to its Rigging and Loading; It remains now, that we go <hi>Artiſt like</hi> to work to charge a Piece, and order all things for the beſt conveniency, and that the leſs danger may follow when you come to Action or Service; and for that purpoſe having planted your Piece upon the plat-form, have in readineſs powder, Bullets, Linſtocks, Scowrers, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the reſt of your things. Stick up your Linſtock to Leeward of you; then to work with your Piece. Firſt, cleer your Piece within with the Scowrer, and ſee that the touch hole be clear, and not ſtopped, and ſo clear, that no dirt or filth be in the ſame; Then let him that is by to aſſiſt, (for a Piece cannot be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by leſs than two) bring the Budg-barrel with the powder juſt before the mouth of your Piece, put then your Ladle into the ſame and fill it, and if it be over-full, give it a little jog, that the overplus may fall down again into the barrel; after this, put it gently in at the mouth of the Piece, even until the end of the Ladle be thruſt up to the Britch end of the Piece; then muſt you turn the Ladle gently and ſoftly, and let it lie within the Chamber of the piece, drawing out your Ladle almoſt to the Muzzle of the Piece, put it back again to take up the looſe corns, which were ſpilt by the way, and to bring them up to the Charge of powder; this done, the Gunner muſt draw out his Ladle, and take out of the Budg-barrel a ſecond Ladle full, (by our former Rules given he muſt know the quantity of powder that his Piece will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) and ſo putting it in the Piece up to the former Ladle-full, then you may draw it out, and do as you did before, that no looſe corns may lie in the bottom of the Piece; and in drawing out his Ladle, he muſt have a care that he let not fall any powder upon the ground; for it is a thing uncomly in a Gunner, to trample powder under feet. Then take a wiſp of Straw, Hay, or any other thing, and put it hard in at the mouth of the Piece, then turn your Ladle end for end to come to the Rammer, thruſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Piece after the wiſp, and drive it up with it, and it will carry all the looſe corns which poſſibly may be ſcattered in the Mold of the Piece; having driven the wad up to the powder, give it two or three gentle ſhoves to make it lie cloſe only, but drive it not too hard leaſt you break your powder too much, which would hinder its force; The wiſp or wad being cloſe to the powder, draw out the Rammer and put in the Bullet, which rowle gently in the Piece up to the wad that was before put in to keep up the powder; the Shot being in, put in a ſecond wad after the Bullet, and thruſt it alſo home to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46160:28"/> the Bullet. Always remembring whilſt the powder is putting in and wadding up, one be ready at the touch hole and keep it ſtopt with his thumb, that no powder fly out at the touch hole, but that it be likewiſe filled with powder, which may be ſupplyed out of his powder-horn.</p>
                        <p>The Gunner that Loads a Piece is to be very careful, and indeavour always not to ſtand before the muzzle of his Piece whilſt he is loading the Piece, but on one ſide of the ſame, leaſt a danger or miſchief might happen to him. And thus the Piece ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its due Charge of Powder and Bullet, he muſt cover the touch-hole with an Apron made of Lead, or for want of that, with dryed Sheep-skin; then let him level his piece and ſet away the Budg-barrel of powder with the reſt of his things, in ſome hollow place under the ground covered over ſafe; he muſt then attend the Gentleman of the Ordnance, or other chief Commander, their Order or Command, before he give fire.</p>
                        <p>Touching the Charges of Pieces, I have given full inſtructions neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, with the weight of powder and Shot for any piece. But to ſay ſomething here touching the quantity of powder, proper for a Load; we do find ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference amongſt Authors; Some whereof do maintain, that there ought to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every Piece for its Charge ſo much powder as half the weight of the Bullet; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of the opinion, that the more powder is put into a Piece, the ſwifter and farther the Bullet will flye, urging many reaſons to prove it. But experience, the Miſtreſs of this Art inſtructeth us better, for if a Piece be loaden with two thirds of the weight of her Shot in powder, it ſends the Bullet or Shot going more ſwiftly, and will carry it farther, which hath been very many and often times tryed, ſo that at this time, 'tis without contradiction.</p>
                        <p>Again, others do maintain, that if one ſhould forcibly Ramme the Bullet, then the powder might take fire before it caſt forth the Bullet, and then would cauſe the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to flye farther than otherwiſe it would do; but you muſt conſider in ſo doing, you either endanger the breaking of the piece, or elſe the making it crooked and unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; becauſe your ordinary Pieces will not bear ſo great a Charge of powder. This hath been tryed by the Sea ſide before his Excellency <hi>Prince Maurice,</hi> of famous memory, where firſt one and the ſame Piece was Loaden with ten pound of fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſee how far She would carry the Bullet; the place being marked where the Bullet reſted. The Piece was loaden again with nine pounds of powder which ſhot as far as when the Piece was Loaden with ten pounds of powder. But laſt of all, this piece of Ordnance being Loaden or Charged with 7 pounds of the ſame powder, it carried her Bullet further than the two former Shots; whence one may obſerve that a piece of Ordnance may be over-Charged, and therefore a good Gunner ought to have a ſingular care to give unto his Piece her due meaſure and Charge.</p>

                        <p>HE that intends to be a Maſter Gunner, and would not abuſe himſelf nor others of the ſame profeſſion, muſt be qualified according to our Inſtructions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He ought to be well skilled in Arithmetick, and to underſtand the Extraction of the Square and Cube Roots, and to have knowledge in Geometry, according to our
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46160:28"/> Inſtructions in the ſecond part, whereby he may be able to take heights, depths, breadths and lengths, and to draw the plot of any piece of ground, to make Mines and Countermines, Rampars, Baskets of earth, and ſuch like things uſed in time of war, as well offenſive as defenſive.</p>
                        <p>He ought moſt chiefly upon Land-Service to be well skilled in the making Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, with Defences, Troniers, Gabbions, Loops, Parapets of Earth, and Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots of 23 or 24 foot high; two foot high of Earth, bed upon bed, unto eleven foot high, and after three foot <hi>Terra plene,</hi> to raiſe the Tronniers and Loops, ſo that for the Cannon it be three foot wide in the Barbe, and within twelve foot wide, without the lower part thereof to deſcend Scarp-wiſe, the better to diſcover the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies avenues and offend them more freely, for avoiding the blaſt and Smoak and ruine it would elſe make: for Culverin two foot and a half within, and nine foot without will ſerve; and for leſs Pieces the leſs meaſure.</p>
                        <p>If the Battery be to be made with Gabbions, they being filled with Earth without Stones, moiſtned and Rammed 7 foot in Diameter, three Ranks between two Pieces, if the place will permit, or two at leaſt; and three Rows alſo one before the other, ſetting one between two, ſo that if one Rank will have three, the ſecond will have two, and the third one; but it will be hard to make a ſafe Battery with Gabbions, Cannon or Culverin proof.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Plat-forms. Let the platform for a Cannon have thirty foot for reverſe, and 27 foot for a Demy-Cannon, and he ought to ſee that his plat-forms be even, or riſing one foot for 20 foot backward the better to ſtay the Reverſe, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the bringing the piece when Loaden to the Loop. The platform ought to be made clean, that no ſtones or other things lye in the way for the wheels to run upon, whereby may be hindered the true intent of his Shot.</p>
                        <p>He muſt before any ſervice is, examine his Piece of its goodneſs or defect; according to our former Inſtructions given in this behalf, he muſt alſo be furniſhed with all neceſſary things for his Artillery, the particulars thereof we have mentioned in the 29 <hi>Chap.</hi> but becauſe it takes not up much paper we will repeat them here again, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wheels, Trucks, Axeltrees, Ladles, Rammers, Spunges, Worms, Tampions, height-board, Auger-bit, fitneſs and roundneſs of the Shot, Chane-Shot, Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar Shot <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Canvas or ſtrong paper for Cartredges, Calabers, Compaſſes, Sight Rule, Gunners Scale, Quadrant, Scales, Weights, priming-Irons, and Aprons to cover the Touch hole.</p>
                        <p>Before he come upon Service, he ought to examine and prove the goodneſs of his Powder and Match, and examine it according to the Rules given where we treat of the Examination of the goodneſs of Powder.</p>
                        <p>A Gunner ought to be moſt careful to ſee that the Powder be placed ſafely from danger of his own, as alſo the Enemies Ordnance, and to be furniſhed with artificial Torches, Dark Lanthorns, with all ſorts of Fire-works, of which you ſhall have a particular account in the Treatiſe of Fire-works at the end of this Book.</p>
                        <p>He muſt have by him his Gyn and Winch, Hand-Spikes, Crowes, to mount and diſmount Guns at pleaſure as occaſion may ſerve, alſo Coynes, Budge-Barrels, Powder Baskets to carry Shot to your Piece, to keep his Linſtocks well armed with good Match.</p>
                        <p>He muſt alwayes have by him a Ruler, Scale, Compaſſes, to meaſure the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters or Bore of every Piece, and likewiſe the length of the Cylinder within, the better to fit her with due Shot and Proportion of Powder.</p>
                        <p>He muſt learn by ſuch Inſtructions as we have already given, the Names, Length, Weight, and Fortification of every Piece about the Chamber, and to tell readily how much Powder is a due Charge for every Piece, and what Shot is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. How many Perſons muſt attend in time of Service, how many Horſes or Oxen will draw a Piece of Ordnance, and in caſe they be wanting, how many men will ſerve. How many pound weight of Shot one man may drive before him in a Wheel-barrow from place to place.</p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:46160:29"/>
                        <p>A Gunner ought chiefly to Charge and Diſcharge a Piece of Ordnance Artiſt like; and when he opens, or orders to be opened the head of a Powder Barrel, let no Iron Tool be uſed thereunto for fear of taking or ſtriking fire; for that purpoſe therefore it is uſual to have wooden Mallets, which will prevent ſuch dangers.</p>
                        <p>Every Gunner before he beginneth to make a Shot, ought to conſider that a wad of Hay, or of untwiſted Ropes, will make the Shot ſhoot wide of the Mark.</p>
                        <p>He ought to conſider whether the Trunions be placed in their due place in the Carriage, whether the Carriage have its due length, whether one wheel be not higher than the other, or whether one wheel doth not reverſe quicker or ſooner than the other, for theſe will cauſe the Piece to erre, and to ſhoot wide of the Mark.</p>
                        <p>Every Gunner ought to conſider, that if his Piece lye point blank or under Metal, then he ought to put in a ſufficient wad after the Shot, to keep it cloſe to the Powder; for if it ſhould not be cloſe, great danger might follow; for if the Shot ſhould lodge any diſtance from the Powder, then in the firing of that Piece it would break off in that very vacant place between the Shot and the Powder, and ſo do dammage to himſelf or ſtanders by. If your Piece be mounted, you then uſe no wad at all after the Shot.</p>
                        <p>Every Gunner ought to have ſtanding by him ſome Tubs of water to wet his Spunges in, whereby to cool his Piece in time of Service, as alſo to be ready upon occaſion to put out any Fire that might happen in time of Service.</p>
                        <p>Every Gunner ought to try whether his Piece is truely bored or not; if it be not, he is to take it into conſideration, and to order his proportion of Charge, according to the thinneſt part of the Metal, to prevent all danger.</p>
                        <p>A Gunner ought to take his Obſervation of the Mark or place he intends to direct his Shot to, juſt over the middle of the bore within the Piece, for by this means he may be able, by his Skill, to make a true Shot in a bad Piece.</p>
                        <p>A Gunner, that he may the better direct his Shot to the place deſired, ought to conſider the difference of the Metal of the Piece at Britch and Muzzle, and thereby truely how to diſpart a Piece, be it either true bored or not. Of diſparting a Piece, I ſhall ſhew how it may be done ſeveral wayes in the following or ſecond part of this Gunnery; where we come to the practical part of the Art in handling a Piece of Ordnance upon all occaſions.</p>

                        <p>If the Thread fall upon the firſt diviſion, then 12 times the ſhadow is the height. If it fall upon the ſecond Diviſion, 6 times the ſhadow is the height. If it fall upon the third Diviſion, 4 times the ſhadow is the height. If it fall on the fourth Diviſion, 3 times the ſhadow is the height. In the fifth Diviſion twice and two fifths of the ſhadow is the height.

                        <p>KNow firſt, that to diſpart a Piece of Ordnance, is no otherwiſe than to bring the Diameter at Muzzle to be equal to the Diameter at the Baſe Ring; in true founde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Ordnance, half of the Diameter of the Cylender is the diſpart; but more generally it may be done thus, Gird the Piece round about the Britch with a thred, after do the like by the Muzzle Ring, lay theſe two ſtrings ſtreight upon a Table at length, and make two marks for the length of each ſtring; divide the diſtance between each of theſe two marks into 22 equal parts with your Compaſſes, and 7 of them are their Diameters; then meaſure how much each Diameter is in length, and ſubſtract one Diameter from the other, then take the juſt half of the difference, and that is the true diſpart of your Piece in inches, and part of an inch.</p>
                        <p>But theſe Diameters are better and more artificially taken with a pair of Crallipars, as we have ſhewed before in taking the Diameter of a Shot, and then meaſured upon your Scale of inches and parts, will give you the true Diameters of the Piece both at Britch and Muzzle, with which work as above.</p>
                        <p>Alſo you may find the true diſpart of a Piece thus; Put a ſmall Wyer or priming Iron in at the Touch-hole of the Piece to the bottom of the Concave; then mind what part of that Iron is even with the Baſe Ring, and make a mark there; then take it out and apply it to the Muzzle, and place it upon the lower edge of the Concave of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46160:44"/> the Piece as upright as you can, and mind what part of the Iron or Wyer is even with the upper part of the Muzzle Ring, and there make a mark; for the difference between theſe two marks, is the true diſpart of the Piece: or after you have placed your Iron upon the Muzzle as before, cauſe a diſpart to be raiſed ſo high as that mark which was made upon the Iron when 'twas put down the Touch-hole.</p>
                        <p>If from the top of the diſpart a fine thread or line be carried to the Muzzle Ring, you will ſee how high you may make a diſpart at the Trunions.</p>
                        <p>Or thus a diſpart may be made at the Trunions; lay a peece of ſoft Wax upon the Trunions, and let one raiſe it high, or depreſs it, until that the Metal at the top of the Baſe Ring, the Wax between the Trunions, and the diſpart of the Muzzle, be all three of one height preciſely; but the former way with a thread is more exact.</p>
                        <p>A Piece of Ordnance may be diſparted thus; take two ſticks (each of them muſt be longer than the Piece) and alſo make a Plummet of Lead to hang in a ſmall thread made faſt to one end of the ſtick, which lay croſs the top of the Baſe Ring, to and fro, until the Plummet deſcending from the end thereof, may juſt touch the ſide of the Metal of the ſaid Ring; then keeping faſt the ſtick in that place, hang your Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met down by the other ſide of the ſtick, until it on the otherſide juſt touch the Metal of the Baſe Ring; when you have done, cut off the ſtick juſt in that place by which the Plummet deſcended, perpendicularly, and this length is the juſt Diameter of the Baſe Ring; after this manner you muſt proceed to take the Diameter at the Muzzle. Then laſtly, ſet theſe two ſticks together even at one end, and mark their difference in length or height; for juſt half of that difference is the diſpart of that Piece.</p>
                        <p>I would adviſe all Sea Gunners upon ſome occaſions to uſe Diſparts between the Trunions of their Pieces, made of a juſt height, on purpoſe to ſerve that place, by the method we have even now preſcribed, and let them be tyed about the Piece with a twine, becauſe elſe at every Shot they will be to ſeek, when upon a ſuddain they ſhould uſe them, and they will much avail and ſtand them in great ſtead. I could expreſs other wayes, only I think theſe ſufficient.</p>

                              <hi>How, if a Shot do carry to the right or to the left, under or over the mark, by reaſon of ſome known fault, to amend it in making the next Shot.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFter you have made one Shot, and find the Piece carry juſt over the mark, then do all that has been taught again, and when your Piece lyes directly againſt the mark, obſerve how much the laſt ſtroak of the Shot is above the mark, ſo much longer make your diſpart, that the top of it may be juſt ſeen from the Britch of the Piece, in a direct line with the ſtroke of the Shot; when it is of this length, then level your Piece with this new diſpart to the aſſigned mark, Give fire, and without doubt it will ſtrike the ſame.</p>
                        <p>If the firſt Shot ſtrike under the mark, then bring the Piece in all points as before to paſs, mark how much of the diſpart is over the ſtroke of the Shot, and cut it juſt ſo ſhort, as being at the Britch you may diſcern the top of it, with the mark on the Baſe Ring and ſtroke of the Shot in a juſt right line, and when you perceive it is of ſuch a length, level the Piece to the aſſigned mark, as at the firſt, then Prime and Give fire.</p>
                        <p>If the firſt Shot ſtrike on the right hand of the mark, to mend it you muſt level the Piece as formerly; you ſtanding behind the Britch of the Piece, obſerve the ſtroke of the Shot over the diſpart, and that part of the Baſe Ring as you at that inſtant look over in a right line towards the diſpart, and the ſtroke of the Shot, ſet up in that place a Pin with a little ſoft Wax on the Baſe Ring; ſo this Pin will be in a right line with the diſpart and ſtroke of the Shot: This being done, level your Piece to the mark aſſigned by this Pin and the diſpart, and without queſtion you will make a fair Shot; for when you level by the Metal of the Baſe Ring where the Pin is placed, and the mark of the Piece ſtanding at that direction, look over the top of the diſpart from the notch in the Baſe Ring, and you ſhall find it to lye juſt ſo much to the left, as the former Shot ſtruck to the right, from the aſſigned mark, which ſhould in all likelyhood now ſtrike the mark.</p>
                        <p>But if a Shot be both too wide and too low, then you muſt uſe both the directions above taught, to make the next Shot: firſt regulate the diſpart by cutting it ſhorter, according as the Shots mark is lower than the aſſigned mark; when this is done, then proceed to my directions to mend ſhooting wide, and theſe things performed with care and diligence, cannot chooſe but mend a bad Shot.</p>

                        <p>FOr the effecting of this matter, we muſt have a Quadrant with a Thread and Plummet (which is deſcribed in the firſt Chapter of this ſecond Section) to one ſide of this Quadrant; ſo that one end of the Ruler may go into the Cavity of the Piece, and let a Piece of Lead be faſtned to the end of the Rule, to make it lye cloſe to the bottom of the Metal within, the Quadrant hanging without, and the Plumb-line ſwaying or hanging down from the Center of the Quadrant, perpendicular to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal line; for the Quadrant being thus placed, you may mount a Piece to what degree you ſhall find fit to ſhoot by.</p>
                        <p>Now every one that will learn to ſhoot at Random, muſt draw his Piece on a level ground, where firſt ſhooting level, he muſt obſerve that diſtance in feet or paces, then mount his Piece to one degree, and mark where that ſhall graze; thus finding the diſtance of every degree from the level to the tenth degree, by theſe diſtances make a Table, to which annex the degrees againſt the diſtance; by which Table you may (uſing the Art of Proportions) find how far another Piece will convey her Shot from degree to degree, and in Loading your Piece for this work you muſt have your Powder exactly weighed, and likewiſe the Wad, and let the Piece cool of it ſelf, and this you muſt do every time; and if the Piece be mounted, there needs no Wad after the Shot; alſo you muſt have a ſpecial care of the ſtrength of the Powder, and let the Powder equally, and with the ſame force and ſtrength be preſſed home, as near as poſſible you may.</p>

                        <p>At 1 degree, the Shot did light from the Piece or place of ſtanding 225 paces.</p>

                        <p>Suppoſe you make tryal of your Piece of Ordnance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the method preſcribed in the laſt Chapter, and find that at 6 degrees of Random upon a level ground, the Shot is conveyed 619 paces, and you are to ply your Piece againſt a place which lyes beyond the point blank, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being 498 paces, to know the degree the Piece muſt be elevated too, do thus; in this Table of Randoms againſt 6 degrees, there is 461 paces; then ſay as 619 paces is to 461, ſo is 498 to 375; which number, or the neareſt to being ſought, in this Table is 370, and ſtands againſt 4 degrees, but becauſe it is not exactly the ſame number, you muſt find out the part of a degree or minute, by a Table of proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts; but if the mark you ſhoot at be lower or higher than your Platformer, then you muſt add or ſubſtract ſo many degrees or minutes from the degrees and minutes found, and the remainder is the degree you ought to mount your Piece to.</p>
                        <p>Now that we may be underſtood well, we muſt know that there are two ſorts of Ranges or Motions of a Shot, of which you may ſee more in Chap. 20. the one is called the Right Range, and the other is termed the Curved or Crooked Range, and theſe two there termed a Compound Range, is called the Dead Range, that is to ſay, the whole diſtance from your Platform from whence the Shot was made, to the place where the Bullet firſt grazes; yet the perpendicular deſcending of the Bullet is alſo called the Natural motion, as you may ſee by the figure hereafter placed. Captain <hi>Hexham</hi> in his Book of Gunnery, ſhews how by finding out the Random of a Cannon for the firſt degree of Mounture to find the Random for every degree to 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is the utmoſt Random, after this manner; Firſt, find out how many paces the Cannon will ſhoot, being laid level by the Metal (which he accounts for one degree of Mounture) divide this diſtance by 50, then multiply the Quotient by 11, and that will bring out the number of the greateſt digreſſion or difference between Range and Range, which being divided by 44, the Quotient will ſhew the number of paces which the Bullet will looſe in the other Ranges from degree to degree. <hi>Example.</hi> A Battering Cannon being laid by the Metal, will ſhoot his Bullet (as he ſaith) 1000 ordinary paces, two foot and a half to each pace; which being divided by 50, the Quotient will be 20, which multiplyed by 11, is 220 paces, which is the number of the next digreſſion made in the ſecond degree: which 220 divide by 44, the number of the remaining degrees yields 5, which is the number of paces to be diminiſhed in each degree; and by this Rule this Table is framed.</p>

                        <p>This Table is rather proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than real, and doth beſt agree with greater Ordnance; but by help of it, working by the Rule of proportion, you may know the Random of any Piece of Ordnance; by firſt (as we have ſaid before) making one Shot, and meaſuring from your Platform that diſtance. You may make a Table for your Piece thus,</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe a Saker being mounted to 5 degrees, ſhoot the Bullet 416 paces, how far will it ſhoot being mounted 10 degrees?</p>
                        <p>As 722 the Tabular diſtance for 5 degrees of Mounture, is to 416 paces the diſtance found,</p>
                        <p>So is the Tabular diſtance for 10 degrees of Mounture, 1214. to the diſtance required, which will be found to be 699, 5 paces.</p>
                        <p>Now if you deſire to know how much of the Horizontal line, is contained directly under the right line of any Shot, called the right Range, made out of any Piece at any elevation.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, know that in plain Triangles, the violent motion or right line of a Shot is ſuppoſed to be the Hypothenuſal, the Angle of Mounture to be the Angle at Baſe; theſe are given, and the Horizontal line is the Baſe which is to be found; there the proportion will run thus;</p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:46160:48"/>
                        <p>As the Radius 90 deg. is to the number of paces in a right Range;</p>
                        <p>So is the Sine Complement of the Angle of Mounture, to the Horizontal Baſe, or the right line which lyes parallel to the Horizon under the way of the Shot.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>BY the third and fourth propoſitions of the ſecond Book of <hi>Tartagilia,</hi> his <hi>Nova Scientia,</hi> he ſheweth that every body equally heavy, as a Shot in the end of the violent motion thereof, being diſcharged out of a Piece of Ordnance, ſo it be not right up or right down, the curved Range ſhall joyn with the right Range, and to the natural courſe and motion betwixt them both, which diſtinct motions you may ſee in the laſt foregoing figure.</p>
                        <p>In the 17 propoſition of the ſame Book, he proveth that every Shot equally heavy, great or little, equally elevated above the Horizon, or equally oblique or level di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, are among themſelves like, and proportional in their diſtance, as the figure following ſheweth, as A E F is like and proportional in right and crooked Ranges unto H I, and in their diſtances or dead Ranges A F unto A I.</p>
                        <p>And in his 4th and 6th propoſitions of the ſame Book, he proveth that every Shot made upon the level hath the mixt or crooked Range thereof equal to the Arch of a Quadrant 90 degrees; and if it be made upon an elevation above the level, that then it will make the crooked Range to be more than a Quadrant: And if that be made imbaſed under the level, that then the crooked Range thereof will be a Quadrant.</p>
                        <p>And in his 9th propoſition of the ſame Book, he ſhews, that if one Piece be Shot off twice, the one level, and the other at the beſt of her Random at 42 ½ deg. Mounture, that the right Range of the length is but the ½ of the dead range of the beſt Random. He that deſires a further Demonſtration of theſe Propoſitions, may peruſe his ſaid ſecond Book <hi>de Nova Scientia.</hi>

                        <p>BEcauſe the Quadrant cannot be conveniently uſed at all times, eſpecially when the wind blows hard, and, being near the Enemies Guns, the Plumb-line is too long before it ſtands ſtill; to remedy this, the Gunners Rule was invented, the figure hereof is as followeth; it muſt be 12 or 14 inches long, according as the Gun will require, it muſt have a long ſlit down the middle thereof like the Eye-Vane of a Quadrant or back Staff, the head thereof make circular or a little hollow, as you ſee in the figure the Inſtrument is deſcribed ſtanding, at 'tis to be placed upon the Britch of a Piece of Ordnance; in the middle of the ſmall narrow ſlit you muſt place a Lute ſtring or a well twiſted Silk with a Bead running upon the ſame to be ſet to any number of inches and parts, or to ſuch a degree of the Quadrant, as you muſt mount your Gun unto; and on the one ſide of the ſlit you muſt place a diviſion of inches, and let every inch be divided into 10 parts, and then it will ſerve for all ſorts of Guns; but if it be for a particular Gun, then on the other ſide you may place the degrees and parts, when you ſhall find by the length of your Piece, how many inches and parts of an inch goes to a degree; but to uſe it with all ſorts of Ordnance, let it only be divided into inches and parts.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The uſe of this Table in graduating the Rule is very plain; for if your Piece of Ordnance be 8 foot long, and you would mount your Piece two degrees, ſeek for 8 foot under the title length of the Piece, and in the common Angle againſt the length of the Piece under two degrees you will find 3, 36, to make a degree; that is 3 inches and 36 parts of an inch, divided into 100 parts, and to this you may ſet your Bead.</p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:46160:49"/>
                        <p>The uſe of the graduated Rule is thus: having loaded your Piece, and brought your Piece of Ordnance in a right line with your mark, the diſpart being placed upon the Muzzle Ring, in like manner place your Rule upon the Baſe Ring, and let one ſtanding by hold it, for the foot of it let it be fitted round to the Gun; ſo you may be ſure to place it right, and you may eſtimate on its perpendicular well enough; now having before the diſtance to the mark you intend to ſhoot at, and admit you have found it to be 461 paces, and the firſt Shot you made for practice out of that Piece conveyed her Shot at two degrees of Mounture 274 paces; then by our former Rules and the Tables of Randoms, there I find 461 againſt 6 degrees, which is the degrees I muſt mount my Piece to reach 461 paces.</p>
                        <p>Then to find by this Table how many inches and hundred parts of an inch 6 degrees will require, look in the Table above, and find on the left hand in the firſt Column the length of the Piece, and juſt under the degrees (as is aforeſaid) you ſhall find the inches and parts of Mounture, to which ſet your Bead on your ſtring, that is in the ſight, to ſo many inches and parts as the Table gives; then mount the Piece higher or lower, until you bring the Bead to the top of the diſpart and mark, all in one line; ſtop then the Piece in ſuch a poſition with a Coyn, then prime and give fire.</p>
                        <p>If you will ſhoot by the Metal of the Piece without a diſpart, then ſubtract the height of the diſpart out of the inches found by the Table, and to the remainder mount your Piece.</p>
                        <p>If you have no Quadrant nor a Ruler, and would make a good Shot, look in the Table, and find the length of the Piece and the inches that you ought to raiſe your Piece unto, then cut a peece of ſtick juſt of that length, and ſet it upon the Baſe Ring, and bring the top of that ſtick, the top of the diſpart, and the mark, all in a right line with your eye, and you will make as good a Shot as if you had a Rule and Bead, or Quadrant.</p>
                        <p>If you will have no diſpart, take your diſpart and meaſure it upon the aforeſaid ſtick at the Baſe Ring, and from it cut off the length of the diſpart, and the remainder uſe upon the Baſe Ring.</p>
                        <p>But if the Mounture ſhould be ſo ſmall that the inches of the diſpart ſhould be more than the inches anſwerable to the degrees of Mounture; then cut off from the diſpart ſo much as 'tis longer than the other, and place it upon the Muzzle Ring, and bring the upper part of the Baſe Ring, the diſpart, and mark, in a right line with your Eye, and you will this way make a level with a ſtick without Inſtrument, as well as if you had Ruler or Quadrant.</p>

                        <p>TO ſhoot by night at the Enemies Lights, diſpart your Piece with a lighted and flaming Wax Candle, or with a lighted Piece of Match, that with your Eye you may bring the Baſe Ring, the fired Match on the Muzzle Ring, and the Enemies Light, in a right line, or mark; then give fire, and you will make a good Shot.</p>

                        <p>If you make a Shot at a Company of Horſe paſſing by, take a Piece that will reach the way the Horſe or Foot are coming in a right line, then let your Gun be ſo loaded with Powder as it may preſently take fire, and let your Shot be fit for your uſe; then take notice of ſome Hillock or ſome turning croſs way for the mark, and when the Enemy comes near to that way in a right line with your Gun, give fire; but for ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Ship upon the River, you muſt put your Piece to ſome eminent mark on the other ſide of the River, and when the Head of the Ship ſhall begin to be between the Piece and the mark, then give fire.</p>
                        <p>But if by ſome miſchievous accident a Shot is lodged in the concavity of a Piece, and there ſticks, and will not go home to the Powder, or come out; then the Gunner, to ſave his Piece from breaking, muſt imbaſe the mouth of the Piece, or put it under the line of level, then put in at the Touch-hole fair warm water at ſeveral times, ſo that it may run out at Muzzle or Mouth of the Piece; and when all the Salt-Peter is waſhed from the Powder, which is known by the taſte of the Water, then let the Gunner clear the Touch-hole, and put in as much Powder as poſſible he can, and prime and give fire, and it will ſerve to draw out the Shot.</p>
                        <p>But when a Shot hath lain long in a Piece until he is grown ruſty, and ſo ſticks faſt, put ſtrong Vinegar warm into the mouth of the Piece, and with the Rammer ſtrike the Shot until it doth move; then put in Vinegar until it run clear through the Powder and Shot; prime as before, and give fire with good Powder, and if it do not run through after it hath ſtood three dayes, clear the Touch-hole, prime and give fire.</p>
                        <p>A man may alſo ſhoot farther than ordinary in one and the ſelf ſame Piece, if the Powder be gently driven home, and wadded accordingly; then the Shot being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Paper, Leather, Oakam, or ſuch like, to fill cloſe to the Powder with a good Wadd, putting after it a Tampion of Cork, and with a Spunge moiſten it with Oyl, annoint the vacant Cylender, and ſo Barricado the Piece that it may not reverſe in the Diſcharge.</p>

Likewiſe the City of <hi>Cambray</hi> was battered, and taken in upon a Curtain, for all there were two ſtrong Bulwarks that flankered it, which if we had run our line upon a Bulwark, we ſhould not have forced it ſo ſoon; yea ſuch an occaſion might preſent it ſelf, that a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may be forced to batter both the one and the other, or to find out ſome ſecret way by undermining a wall, and blowing it up with powder.</p>

                           <p>This is for your great Towns; but what ſay you to a Caſtle, a Cittadel, or ſome narrow Fortreſs, how will you go to work to take in thoſe with the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?</p>

                           <p>As for your Forts, and Caſtles, it is much better to batter them upon a mount or a Bulwark, than upon a Curtain: my reaſon is this, that in theſe your Bulwarks lying cloſe one by another, will flank one another with the greater force, and hide the Curtain much better to defend it, ſo that one cannot ſo eaſily force it, if the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes be not taken away.</p>

                           <p>Go to then; a Town then being to be battered, either upon a Curtain or a Bulwark, how many Pieces of Ordnance would you have to do it, and, how and in what manner would you place, and plant your Ordnance upon your batteries to make a good breach?</p>

                           <p>To effect this, I would have 18 Pieces of Canon and half Canon, <hi>(for leſſer Pieces for Battery are now grown out of uſe.)</hi>

                           <p>To batter a place well either upon a ſtony or earthy wall, you may aſſure your ſelf, the more whole Cannon you have, the greater and the more ſufficient your breach will be: for your great battering Pieces do ſpoil and beat down any thing, which doth meet with their great force and violence: <hi>Howſoever of late years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught at divers Seiges that your half Canon which are more portable, having good ſtore of them, will do the buſineſs aſwell as your whole Canon.</hi>

                           <p>I would counſel a General to approach as near unto that place as poſſible may be, and make his Batteries ſome two or three hundred paces one from another, and that if it were poſſible to advance covertly the Approach and ſap, even up to the Counter-ſcharfe, and very brink of the Moat, to prepare a way for his Gallery: not only to Batter that place being at hand with the greater force, but alſo to keep in, and hinder an Enemy from Sallying out upon the Beſiegers, to diſcover and diſmount their Ordnance in <hi>Caſemates,</hi> or if they have ſunk any in their Walls or Falſe-bray, and ſo to terrifie them, that they dare not ſtir out.</p>

                           <p>I am alſo of your opinion, and hold it for good, yet I fear this will not be ſo ſoon done, and is ſooner ſpoken, than executed, and that before you can bring your approach and ſap ſo far, it will coſt you warm blood, and a great many mens lives, if you have a ſtout Enemy within to deal withal, and one that is very Vigilant, and careful to ſtand upon his Guard, and his defence.</p>

                           <p>'Tis true, this cannot be done without danger, and the loſs of men, but he that is fearful muſt ſtay at home, and not come into the Wars where there is neither place nor time, which doth free or exempt him from danger: yet the danger is not alwayes ſo great, eſpecially in ſuch places, where you have Earth enough to work with, to caſt up your ſapps, and to heighten and deepen your Approaches, which will ſhow you the way, for the more higher you find the ground in Approaching to the edge of the moat, the deeper Trenches you may make, and cover your ſelf by caſting up of blinds continually, to keep you from the ſight of the Beſieged; and it is better, when you have brought your approach as it were under them, than if you were 200 or 300 paces diſtant from them.</p>

                        <sp>

                           <p>I would make a great Battery with 8 of them to beat upon a right line, either upon a Curtain, or the point of a Bulwark (which the General ſhall find fitteſt) Two Batteries with each 3 Canon to play ſlope-wiſe from the great Battery; as the ninth plate and 28 and 29 figures ſhows, and two Batteries, with two half Canon a Piece, to play as it were croſs-wiſe upon the breach. And thus you ſee your 18 Pieces planted upon 5 Batteries, as you may obſerve in the 9th. Plate, and the two Figures of a Curtain and of a Bulwark following.</p>

                           <p>Good Sir tell me I pray you how many ſhot will theſe 18 Pieces of Canon make in 10 hours, and how much powder will they require.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                           <p>In 10 hours they may make ſome 1500 ſhot, and will require a matter of 25000 pound weight of powder, that is 150 barrels full, each barrel containing 160 pound weight in it.</p>

                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                           <p>You make your account then that every Piece in the ſpace of 10 hours is to ſhoot 80 ſhot, that is 8 ſhot an hour for every Piece.</p>

                        <sp>

                           <p>You may make 10 ſhot in an hour if you pleaſe, if your Pieces be renforced; but as for your ordinary Pieces, they have not metalline ſubſtance enough to bear it: conſidering alſo that after you have made 40 ſhot out of a Piece, it will be ſo heated, that it muſt have a cooling time, which muſt be at leaſt an hour, for otherwiſe your Piece being grown over hot, it may cauſe danger.</p>

                           <p>Methinks that 80 ſhot for a Piece in ſo long a time were too little, having often heard, that in that while, a Piece may well be ſhot off 130 times; can you give me your reſolution upon this?</p>

                           <p>I will tell you Sir what hapned once in the Iſland of <hi>Bomble,</hi> Anno 1599. we planted a Piece by a mill, by which we did annoy the Enemy very much, ſo that they were forced to make a Battery, and planted a whole Canon, and a demy-Canon upon it, ſeeking to diſmount ours. Now ſhooting with this Piece from four of the clock in the morning, till eleven toward noon, this Piece had a cooling time the ſpace of two hours, and about one of the clock we began to play with it again, and continued ſhooting with it till 4 a clock in the afternoon; but this Piece being not able to endure the force and heating of ſo many ſhot, we were conſtrained to leave off with it: and yet ceaſed not ſhooting with our other Pieces from another Battery by command from <hi>Don Lewes de Valaſco,</hi> General of our Ordnance, and ſhooting croſs-wiſe with ſome other of our Pieces, we put the Enemies two Pieces to ſilence in the ſpace of an hour; a Souldier of ours ſtanding by, was curious to keep a tally of the number of all the ſhot we made from the morning till four a clock in the afternoon, and ſhewed me 80 notches, which deducting the two hours cooling, our Piece planted at the Mill made 8 ſhot in an hour, which was as much as could be required of it.</p>

                        <q>Senior <hi>Diego Uffano</hi>give your Tranſlator leave to interrupt you a little, and ſo to conclude this diſcourſe. If you remember at the Seige of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> which you mention ofttn
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46160:51"/> in your Chapters and Dialogues, you were without, and I was within the Town, that on the ſeventh of <hi>January, Anno 1602. Stilo Novo,</hi> After Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> of famous memory (who defended and kept the Town againſt you) had deluded you with a <hi>Parley,</hi> only to gain time, and to make up our Canon and Sea-beaten works along the skirt of the old Town, his Highneſs the Archduke reſolved to aſſault us, and that morning began to batter <hi>Sand-hill</hi> and <hi>Schotenburgh,</hi> to make a breach for you againſt that night, with intent to Aſſault us (as you did) and to have entred the Town, and have put us all to the Sword, the Relation whereof you ſhall hear in the end of this Book. Now you had placed and planted your 20 Pieces of Cannon to batter them in this manner, 8 from your Battery at the foot of the <hi>Downs, 8</hi> from a Battery on the right hand of the <hi>Downs,</hi> 6 from your pile Battery, 6 more which you had made upon the Sand, and as it were raiſed out of the Sea: the firſt ſhot upon the breach in a right line, and the other two ſlope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as your two figures following do demonſtrate. Theſe 20 Pieces of Canon towards noon had a cooling time, for a matter of ſome 2 hours, juſt as you have ſaid; and afterwards you began to batter the breach and old Town again, till it was almoſt twilight, and then they cooled again, till you were ready to give us an aſſault; and before you fell on, as I do well remember, you ſhot off one of your Cannons with a hollow Bullet, which flew over the Town and made a great humming noiſe, as a warning Piece to the <hi>Count of Bucquoy,</hi> who lay on the Eaſt-ſide, that you were then ready to fall on, and that he ſhould do the like, this was your Signal. Now <hi>General Vere</hi> knowing well your intent, gave order to the Gentleman of our Ordnance who had the guard upon <hi>Sand-hill,</hi> that he ſhould keep a true Tally, and an account of all the ſhot you made that day, with your 20 Pieces of Cannon upon the breach and the old Town, which being caſt up, there were found to be made that day from morning till night 2200 ſhot, which was found to be an 110 ſhot for every Piece, and 11 ſhot an hour for every Piece, which is more than 8; but I verily believe your Pieces were renforced. <hi>This by the way, and ſo I return again to your own Dialogue.</hi>

                           <p>I am of your mind, and prefer ſuch a battery before all others, who are of the opinion that they had rather chooſe a Curtain than a Bulwark to be battered.</p>

                           <p>You have heard my reaſons for that, and ſee the figures following traced out to you. But as for your <hi>Bulwark</hi> the <hi>beſieged</hi> may cut it off (as you may mark in the figures of <hi>Retrenchments</hi> and <hi>Cuttings off</hi> in the ſecond part of this book) for indeed it will be a hard matter to force an Enemy out of a Bulwark, who is reſolved to looſe it by peecemeal and degrees; and there is not ſo much danger in aſſaulting of a Curtain, which being once well battered and beaten down with your Ordnance, you have an eaſier way and entrance to fall on with your Troops of men, to enter the Town or Fortreſs; but for the defence which is made from your Flanking Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, or your Caſemates, you muſt make Batteries upon the brink of the moat againſt them, (as is ſaid) to diſmount the Enemies Pieces, and to flanker with your Ordnance the Parapets of the Bulworks to beat them about their ears, that the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works may lye the more open to you, and I think this way is the leaſt danger.</p>

                           <p>No, for the Rampire being thinner, you have neither ſo much ground, nor the like accommodation in a Curtain as in a Bulwark; and indeed, a Governour
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46160:52"/> of a Town, or of a Fortreſs, if he were put to his choice, had rather to be aſſaulted on a Bulwark (than on a Curtain) by cutting it off into the form of a half moon, that he might make a new reſiſtance, and defend it with a leſs number of men. Beſides, in a Bulwark the Beſieged have this advantage over the Aſſailants, which is very dangerous for them, that they may make a Mine within the bowels of their Bulwark when an Enemy ſhall attempt to aſſault it, and thinking to enter the Breach and take the Town, they may be blown up into the Air by a Countermine; the like alſo may happen to the Beſieged, the Aſſailants ſpringing their Mine alſo in a Bulwark, when they think they ſtand upon their beſt defence.</p>

                           <p>No, it will not take the like effect as in a Bulwark; for a Breach being once made in a Curtain, for as an Enemy may aſſault it at large, ſo they may bring a greater number of men to fight, to help to defend it; whereas in a Bulwark they are pen'd up and ſtraightned in a narrow place, which may be cut off, and will require a fewer number of men to defend it, whereas thoſe which are to force it, muſt be conſtrained to bring up a great many men to aſſault, who in an inſtant may be in danger of blowing up.</p>

                           <p>Your reaſons (Good Captain) are not to be ſlighted; but as for me, I hold it ſafer, to batter and aſſault the breach of a Bulwark, than of a Curtain. For though the beſieged may cut it off, and defend it with a fewer number of men, yet the Aſſaulters have this advantae over the Beſieged defendants, that they have more place and elbow room, and may find a leſs reſiſtance than in a Curtain, ſeeing that one may make as a great a breach in a Bulwark as in a Curtain, becauſe your Ordnance may beat it flat, and level with the ground; and chooſing rather a Bulwark: I will herewith conclude this diſcourſe, and now ſhew you the figures both of the one, and of the other in this following plate.</p>

                              <hi>Containing the demonſtration of Morters, and the uſe of them.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>YOur great and ſmall Morters, are not only ſerviceable in a War offenſive, by ſhooting and caſting of great Granadoes, as of 100, 150, 170 pound weight, and ſmaller of 40, and 50 pound; but alſo by caſting of Fire-balls, Stones, old Rubbidge, and Pieces of Iron, into Cities, Towns, and Fortreſſes; and may be uſed alſo defenſively, to be ſhot from Towns and Forts into any Enemies works, and approaches; eſpecially they are of ſingular uſe, when an Enemy hath covertly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and lodged himſelf under ſome Bulwark, Tower, or Turret, and is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to undermine them; which if they do, you may plant one of theſe Morters at a reaſonable diſtance, on the inſide of your Wall, and ſhooting your Granado, as it were bolt upright into the air, by its natural fall, it may light juſt into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies works, and there with great violence breaking among them, it will make them cry, fly, and forſake the place; you may alſo fire them out of a place, by caſting good ſtore of Hand Granadoes down among them, and ſo annoy them, that the work will be too hot for them.</p>
                        <p>Two of theſe Morters are repreſented unto you, in the Plate and Figures follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing number. Now for the ſhooting a way of your great Granadoes or Fireballs, you muſt ever remember, but to take ⅕ or 1/7 parts of fine Powder of the weight of your
<pb facs="tcp:46160:53"/>
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:46160:53"/> Granado or thing which you ſhoot; but if you are to ſhoot away a Bullet without any Fire-works in it, or ſome maſſie ſtone, or ſuch like ſolid thing, then you muſt take but half the weight of it in fine Powder, which, having given fire to the Morter, will ſend it going merrily.</p>
                        <p>The uſe of them is not to ſhoot in a right line, as other Ordnance do, but in an oblique line, as you may ſee by the two Figures following, unleſs your Morter be mounted to 90 degrees, mounting them uſually above 45 degrees, namely to 60, 70, 80, and ſometimes more or leſs, as the diſtance and fall of your Granado or Shot ſhall require.</p>
                        <p>Having before ſhown you the making and uſe of the Quadrant, it remains now that I come to the charging and uſe of a Morter; now before you put in your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. it muſt be well ſponged and cleared, whether you charge it with looſe Powder, or Cartouch, turning the mouth almoſt bolt upright; the Powder being put into the Chamber, you muſt ſtop it with a Wadd either of Hay or Oakam, and after a Tampkin of ſome ſoft wood, and this with the Powder that was put in firſt, it muſt fill up the whole Chamber thereof, that there may be no vacuity between the Powder and the Wadd, or between the Wadd and the Shot; this done, the ſhot ſhall be put in at the mouth, with another Wadd after it; but you muſt have a care that your Morter be not much mounted, leſt your ſhot flyes out too ſoon, and the Wadd between the Tampkin and the ſhot will not only ſave the ſhot from the Tampkins breaking of it, but alſo is to avoid vacuities which may endanger the breaking of the Piece by ſecond expanſions.</p>
                        <p>Now then having reſolved of the premiſſes, touching your Piece, Shot, and Powder, as aboveſaid, and upon the diſtance and mounture of your mark, as the Rules and Tables following ſhall direct you, then for the bending and diſpoſing of it to the aſſigned mark; lay firſt a ſtraight Ruler upon the Mouth of your Morter, and upon it place a Quadrant (as you may ſee by the Figures) or ſome other Inſtrument croſs-wiſe, to ſet the Morter upright, for ſhuning of wide ſhooting, and then placing them fore-right to elevate it into the reſolved degree of Mounture, to avoid ſhort or overſhooting, accordingly as the Tables following will teach you; for having made one ſhot, you may thereby proportion the reſt, conſidering whether you are to ſhoot with or againſt the wind, or whether it blows towards the right or the left hand, whether weakly or ſtrongly, and ſo accordingly to give or abate the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or diſadvantage, which judgment and diſcretion will induce you thereunto, and the help of the Rules following.</p>
                        <p>Now we will come to the uſe of a Morter, and that in this example following; Suppoſe an Enemy be approached to the <hi>Baſis,</hi> or foot of a Wall or a Bulwark, and there is a rooting, and begins to make a Mine, and having Chambred his Powder, intends to blow it up, and that there is no other means left you, to repulſe and hinder their egreſs and regreſs into it; but by ſhooting out of your Morters ſome Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Stones, and Rubbiſh among them, or at leaſt by caſting many Hand-Granadoes down upon them. To do this either by force or policy, it behoveth a good Canonier or Fire-worker, to know firſt (as hath been taught) how far his Morter will carry a Granado, or any ſolid thing elſe, which ſhall be ſhot out of it, being ſet upon ſuch and ſuch a degree and elevation as the Morter Figure will ſhew you. As for Example, take your aim level with the mould or mouth of your Morter, noted A upon the Quadrant, and it will carry 200 paces, where you ſee the Granado falls upon the letter A; but your morter being elevated to the mark B, it then will carry its Bullet 487 paces; if to the ſecond C, then 755 paces; if to the third D, it will carry 937 paces; if to the fourth E, then 1065 paces; if to the fifth elevation F, then 1132 paces; if to the ſixth G, which is in the midſt of the Quadrant, and lyes then upon its higheſt elevation, it will carry 1170 paces, as you may ſee by the ſeveral falls of the Bullets upon every Letter. The ſecond Figure ſhews you a Morter caſting a Granado upon a Caſtle, as you may ſee by the Example.</p>

We ſhall therefore be contented to make choice of ſome of the beſt and principal things among ſo great a number, but more particularly of ſome moſt admirable inventions; and we ſhall give a Chapter to every kind of Fire-work, conſidering they differ among themſelves both in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and effect, and every one hath its name which is particularly applyed to it. But before we begin with our compoſition we ſhall begin with the particulars, and their preparation unto this work, whereby they may be the more exalted, and have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter efficacy. The more principal materials, that is, Peter, Charcoal and Sulphur, are mentioned at large in my firſt part of Gunnery, and therefore we ſhall proceed.</p>

                           <p>TAke a good quantity of clarified Sulphur, (the way of Clarification we have ſhewed before) melt it over a very gentle fire in an Earthen or Copper Veſſel, then take old red Tyles that have been already uſed in buildings, or if you cannot find ſuch, take new Tyles that are well baked, and that have not taken dirt, break them in pieces as ſmall as a Bean, and throw them into melted Brimſtone, then min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle your Brimſtone with the remaining fragments of the Bricks, until they have drank up all the Sulphur, then let them be put into a Limbeck upon a Furnace to diſtil, and after the Oyl is drawn according to a Chymical order it will be very excellent, and aboveall, have a very combuſtible quality, proper to the Compoſitions of artificial fires.</p>

                           <head>To prepare Oyl or Balſam of Sulphur.</head>
                           <p>Fill a long body of Glaſsfull of Sulphur well powdered, then pour upon it Oyl of Turpentine, or Oyl of nuts, or Juniper, in ſuch a quantity that the oyl with the Sulphur may fill but the half part, place it in an Iron Kettle; with Sand round about it, and a ſmall heat for 8 or 9 hours, and you will ſee that the Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine will convert the Brimſtone into a red Oyl, as fiery and combuſtible as before.</p>
                           <p>There are thoſe that take the following matter to the preparing the oyl of Sulphur, to the end it may be rendered more combuſtible, <hi>viz.</hi> Sulphur 1 <hi>l.</hi> of quick Lyme half a pound, of Sal-armoniac 4 ounces.</p>
                           <p>Above all this, the Chymiſts know how to prepare a certain oyl of Sulphur, (which they call a Balſam) of which the virtues are ſo admirable, that they admit not any body, either living or dead, to be touched with putrification, but will conſerve it in ſo perfect and entire ſtate, that neither the pernicious Influences of the celeſtial bodies, nor that corruption which the Elements produce, nor that which reduces things into their Principles, can any way damnifie it, if anoynted with it. There is alſo from it prepared a certain fire (as <hi>Tritemius</hi> teacheth) with flowers of <hi>Sulphur, Borax</hi> and <hi>Brandy-wine,</hi> which will remain many years without extinguiſhing of it ſelf. Others that are knowing, do atteſt that a Lamp may be filled with ſuch like Oyl, from whence all that are within the Light of it, will appear as if they had no heads.</p>
                           <p>There is another way of making Oyl of Sulphur which is very admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, which is prepared thus. Incorporate well together an equal proportion of Sulphur and Salt-Peter, reduce them into moſt ſubtile Powder, and paſs it through a fine ſieve, then put them into an Earthen Pot that hath never been uſed, and pour upon them Vinegar made of <hi>White-wine</hi> or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> as much as will cover the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Cloſe the Pot in ſuch manner that no air may any wiſe enter, and put it thus in any hot place ſo long time until all the vinegar be digeſted and vaniſhed. Laſtly, take that matter which reſts in the Pot, and draw from thence an oyl, by Chymical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper to this work.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>TAke Benjamin a certain quantity of ounces, put it into a Gourd or a Limbeck glaſs, and cloſe it well with a blind head (as they call it) then have in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs an earthen veſſel, ſet it upon a Tresfoot, or for the more certainty upon a ſmall Furnace, place it in your glaſs body, and compaſs it well about with fine Sand or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes ſo high as the matter is in the glaſs; after make a moderate fire under it, for fear the Limbeck heat too ſoon, and be too hot, for that will make the flowers become citrine or yellow, when they ought to be as white as Snow. Obſerve when you ſee the flowers begin to raiſe a vapour or ſmall fume, continue your fire in that ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the ſpace of one quarter of an hour; after you ſhall ſee the flowers riſen unto the internal Superficies of the blind head, then take it away carefully, and put to it another that ſhall be quite cold, and put that which you have taken off upon a white paper until it be cold, then gently with a Feather or wooden Spatula, cauſe the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to come forth of the blind head, and gather them together carefully: thus you may add a third or fourth blind head, and in time many, until all the Benjamin ceaſe to fume.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin may be made into flowers another way, thus; put into a glazed pot a certain quantity of ounces of Benjamin, and place it upon warm aſhes, and when you ſee it begin to fume, cover the veſſel with a Cornet of paper made in the form of a Cone, and a little larger than the orifice of the pot, leave it there about one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, after take off the Cornet, and take the flowers and gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; then put upon the veſſel another Cornet of paper, and let it ſtand as long as before; take it off, and gather the flowers to the former, and continue thus putting Cornet after Cornet, until your flowers be entirely evaporated.</p>

The flame that comes from thence is very clear, and of a very agreeable odour; after it hath remained ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the air ſome time it vaniſheth inſenſibly. The cauſe that produceth all theſe rare effects from Camphire, is by reaſon its parts are extream ſubtil and airy.</p>
                        <p>I do add to all this, that it may be eaſie to reduce Camphire into Powder, to make it uſeful in artificial fireworks, if a man crumbles it and beats it gently, rouling it with Sulphur. The oyl of Camphire, which ſerves alſo for the ſame effect, is made by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a little of oyl of ſweet Almonds, and ſtir them well together in a braſs Morter, and peſtle of the ſame metal, until all be converted into oyl of a greeniſh colour.</p>

                        <p>THe Hand Granadoes reſpecting their form, are Globically or perfectly round and hollow in their interior part in manner of a Sphere; they are called Hand Granadoes, or Handy Granadoes, becauſe they may be graſped in the hand, and thrown to the Enemies; and if we ſhould dwell upon the denominations of the Latine, we may call them as they do, <hi>Granades Palmares,</hi> they are commonly of the bigneſs of a Bullet of Iron of 5, 6, and 8 <hi>l.</hi> they weigh ſometimes 1 <hi>l.</hi> and ſometimes one pound and a half, ſome are of two pounds, and others of three pounds; there is given to theſe ſort of Globes the names of <hi>Granadoes,</hi> by reaſon of the great reſemblance they have with the Fruit <hi>Punique,</hi> which we call <hi>Pom-granad;</hi> for as theſe do ſhut up in their rinds a great quantity of grains; ſo our Military Globes are filled with a number of Grains of Powder, almoſt innumerable, the which having received the Fire, do break into a thouſand and a thouſand ſhivers, leaping againſt the Enemy, and piercing if it could all ſuch things as it meets oppoſing its violence. They are generally made of Iron or Copper, carrying in its Diameter about three Ounces, being about the length of a Barly Corn in thickneſs of Metal; they are filled commonly with Gun-Powder, and ſometimes of other Compoſitions, there is added to its Orifice a ſmall Pipe commonly called a Fuſe, which is filled with a matter or Compoſition that is ſlack or ſlow in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but nevertheleſs very ſuſceptible of the Fire, and capable to hold fire ſome time, for fear that it ſhould break in the hands of thoſe that mannage it, and intend to throw it.</p>
                        <p>There is amongſt Fire-Maſters accounted three ſorts of Hand Granadoes, the firſt and moſt common are made of Iron; others are made of Braſs, allayed with other Metals in the melting; the third ſort is of Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>If you cauſe them to be made of Iron, take ſuch as is moſt fragile, and as little wrought as poſſible you can get; if you will caſt them of Copper, you muſt allay ſix pound of Copper, with two pounds of Tyn, and half a pound of Marcaſite, or you may put one part of Tyn with three parts of Lattin or of <hi>Auricalque.</hi> Thoſe that are made of Iron are in thickneſs about the ninth part of the Diameter; thoſe that are made of Braſs muſt have one tenth part of the Diameter in thickneſs of Metal.

                        <p>ACcording to the definition which we have given of them, it is moſt evident, and I ſuppoſe no body will doubt, that they are to be taken in the hand, and that we muſt graſp them to throw them at the Enemy. It is ſaid before that this kind of Arms is as well defenſive as offenſive; therefore we ſhall not reſt upon the proof of theſe things; thoſe that have been at the managing of them muſt inſtruct them that are ignorant.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall ſay only this, that the Places where theſe Hand Granadoes are uſed at Sea, are where Ships are Board and Board to clear the Enemies Decks, ſo that the way may be cleared there. Upon Land Service they are uſed immediately after the good and happy ſucceſs of a Mine which hath made a great overture in a Rampire, overthrowing one part of the Wall, Bulwark, or Baſtion, to give place to the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, to do their endeavour to get into the breach; it is there that the Beſieged as well as Beſiegers may make uſe of theſe Hand Granadoes; 'tis there where you ſhall ſee the more generous of both ſides armed with Fire and Flames, defending valiantly the quarrel of their Prince, the intereſt of their Party, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

They are imployed alſo upon other occaſions, to wit, when the Beſiegers are come up to the Walls of the Rampire, and ſo well placed, that making winding Stairs in the thickneſs of the Platform, they mount inſenſibly by retact; ſo that the Beſieged cannot any way hinder by the defence of their Flanks, nor be kept ſafe by the Rampires themſelves. Upon theſe occaſions I ſay, the Beſieged ought to pour down a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46160:62"/> a quantity of Hand Granadoes from aloft, or from the top of the Walls, upon their under-miners.</p>
                        <p>And ſometimes they are alſo thrown at a diſtance greater than ordinary, according to the occaſion; but when this cannot be done by the natural ſtrength of a Soldier, without the aid of ſome artificial Inſtrument, the Maſters in this Art have invented certain ſmall Engines, made like unto one of our Ducking-Stools, with a Rope at one end to pluck it down by force, and at the other end a hollow place to lay the Balls in that are to be thrown, and with this Engine well contrived, one may throw upon the Enemy, not only Hand Granadoes; but alſo a quantity of other Artificial Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Fires, as gliſtring or ſhining Globes, Bombards, Fire-pots, and many other ſuch like things, of which we ſhall ſpeak in their place, may be thrown at a greater diſtance than is poſſible by the hand only.</p>
                        <p>This Inſtrument is not very difficult to make, it may eaſily be comprehended by what we have ſaid. I ſhall only advertiſe you of one thing, that the longer the arm of the Engine is on that ſide that is to hold the Granadoes, more than the other part to which the Rope is faſtned, the greater force the Engine will have; but you muſt underſtand this meaſure to be made from Axes or Iron Rolls, upon which the Arm moves.</p>

                        <p>IT is practice that hath been practiſed in former times to ſhoot red hot Fire-balls, and was counted of great defence, as you may find amongſt many other things in the Works of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>Tyrios immiſſe in Alexandri Magni machinamenta maſſas ferreas candentes:</hi> Out of many Authors may be proved the cuſtomary uſe in former times of Shooting red hot Pieces of Iron., which we ſhall not dwell upon, but come to the Practice. Firſt, you muſt Charge the Piece of Ordnance according to the cuſtomary manner, his due proportion of Powder, upon this Powder you muſt put a Wooden Cylender or Fidd, of a juſt and equal wideneſs with the bore of the Piece, which muſt be driven very ſtiff home to the Powder, and for your better ſecurity, you muſt put upon this another wad made of Straw, Hay, or of Oakam, or Tow; this being done, let the Piece be laid a little under Metal, and then cleanſe the vacant place or hollow of the Piece with a Spunge, ſo that all the Grains of Powder that are there, may be taken away. This being done, lay your Piece to bear with the place you intend to ſhoot at, according to the method we have given in the ſecond Part of Gunnery, and let your Piece thus remain until you have put in your red hot Bullet: your Bullet muſt be ſure to be exactly round, and not ſo high, but that it may run freely down in the Piece to the wad, the Shot being red hot, take it out of the fire with a pair of Tongs made for that purpoſe, and put it into the Piece, and give an attentive Ear, for as ſoon as the Shot is ſuppoſed to be up to the Wad, give immediately Fire to your Piece of Ordnance.</p>
                        <p>There are others which put into their Pieces Boxes made of Plate, of Iron or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Others do put into their Pieces Potters Clay, and upon them the fiery Bullet, which with a quick hand they thruſt home with a Rammer, which ought to be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from fire by lining the Rammer head with Copper. But theſe are more perillous; and therefore we account that method above to be the beſt, and moſt free from danger.</p>

On the choaking or contracting the paper together at one end, within one Diameter of the end, except only a little hole, about one quarter the Diameter of the bore thereof, to contract theſe Caſes on this manner, do thus, wet the end about one inch in water, then put the Rouler in again, and tye a great packthread about the wet within three quarters of an inch of the end, put another thing almoſt of the ſame Diameter with the Rouler in at the wet end about half an inch, hold it there, get ſome

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving prepared a Rocket with a report in the head, ſuch as I taught you firſt to make, tye it to a bladder, ſo that the end of the Rocket may come to the month of the ſaid bladder, and bind it over very ſtrongly, then firing it out of your hand, caſt it away from you, it matters not which way, ſo it will come to the ground; there by reaſon of the bladder, it cannot ſtay, but preſently rebounds upwards, moving to and fro, until all be ſpent: there is another ſort, and that is a ſmall rocket, put into a bladder, and ſo blown up round about it, and tyed about the neck thereof, which will have delightful motions.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Of the many defects in Fuzees, how they may be avoided, and of ſuch things as ought to be obſerved in their good Conſtruction.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THe firſt and moſt notable defect which is obſerved in Fuzees, is that after they are lighted or riſen into the Air the height of 1, 2, or 3 Perches, they break, and do diſſipate without making their entire effects.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, which is little better, is after it is remaining ſuſpended upon the nail it conſumes but very leiſurely, without going away or raiſing it ſelf in the Air.</p>
                        <p>The third is, when they are raiſed in the Air, they deſcribe only an Arch of a Circle like a Rainbow, and return upon the earth again before the Compoſition in the Fuzee be conſumed.</p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46160:69"/>
                        <p>The fourth is when it moves in a ſpiral manner, whirling in the Air without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving an equal motion; that is not right as it ought to be.</p>
                        <p>The fifth is when it mounts ſloathfully and negligently, as if it diſdained or refuſed to elevate it ſelf into the Air.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth and laſt is, that the Caſe or Cartouch remains hanging upon the Nail quite empty, and the Compoſition doth riſe and diſſipate alone into the Air. There is many other vexations and inconveniencies which may give trouble to the Practitioners in theſe Arts with vain expence, which would looſe too much time to repeat: It will be ſufficient if you take notice of theſe which are principal, whereby, if by ill fortune you be faln into any of theſe defaults, you may correct your error eaſily, and then immediately correct thoſe faults. And for this purpoſe, obſerve the rules given in the next Chapter.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Infallible Rules by which you may make Fuzees, or Rockets, without any default.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>FIrſt, that they have their height proportionable to the Diameter of their Orifice, as we have before declared.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Cartouch ought to be of wood, or glued or paſted paper, not too thick, nor too thin.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they ought to be made of ſtrong paper of indifferent dryneſs, properly rouled and well compacted cloſe upon the Former.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the necks ought to be bound about very ſtrongly and firm, in ſuch a ſort, that the knot of the thred, and the folds of the Cartouch, may not lye amiſs one upon the other.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, all the Materials of the Compoſition muſt be exactly weighed according to the proportion of the Orifice of the Fuzee that you would charge, and alſo well beaten and ſifted particularly; after, having weighed them again, and mixed them in one body well together, you muſt pound them again, and paſs them through the Sieve as you did before.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, that the Salt-Peter and Sulphur be powdered and clarified as much as poſſible may be, and the Coal perfectly well burned and exempted from all humidity, and made of wood that is light and ſoft, as the Teile, the Hazle, and the branches of the Willow Tree; and on the contrary, 'tis neceſſary to have a care, that you make not uſe of ſuch Coals as are made of Birch, Oak, nor Maple, becauſe they contain in them much weighty and terreſtial matter.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, matters for Rockets or Fuzees ought to be prepared immediately before they are intended for uſe, and not before.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, the matters of Compoſition ought to be neither too dry nor too moiſt, but moiſtned a little with ſome Oliganious matter, or with a little Brandywine.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, there muſt be put into the Cartouch alwayes an equal quantity of the Compoſition at a time, and ſo beat it down alike; and thus do until it be filled.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, you muſt beat the Compoſition alwayes with the Rammer right up, or perpendicularly, and take care that in the beating it be not made crooked.</p>
                        <p>Eleventhly, You muſt ſtrike down the Compoſition with a wooden Mallet, that is of heft proportionable to the bigneſs and thickneſs of the Rocket, and alwayes with an equal ſtrength, and juſt number of ſtroaks, every time you put in any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46160:70"/>
                        <p>Twelfthly, in Cartouches made of paper, you muſt put in round peeces of wood hollowed; but in thoſe that are made of wood, you muſt put ſuch as are ſmooth, without any channel or hollowing, to the end that it joyn the better to the ſides of the Fuzee, where it muſt joyn firmly, as well without as within.</p>
                        <p>13. The Fuzee muſt be peirced with a Bit or Awl that is convenient, in ſuch a ſort that the hole be not too big nor too ſtraight, nor too long nor too ſhort.</p>
                        <p>14. The hole muſt be made the moſt ſtreight and perpendicular that may be poſſible, and juſt in the middle of the Compoſition, to the end that it lean nor to any one ſide, more than to the other.</p>
                        <p>15. The Fuzee muſt not be peirced before it be intended for uſe, and after it is pierced you muſt handle it tenderly, only with the ends of your fingers, for fear of deforming it.</p>
                        <p>16. The Pearch or Stick to which you faſten the Fuzee, ought to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as well in length as weight; it muſt not be crooked nor winding in any manner, neither unequal, nor full of knots, but ſtreight as poſſible can be made, and muſt therefore be made ſmooth, and ſtreightned with a Plain, if need requires.</p>
                        <p>17. After they are Charged, they muſt not be laid into too dry a place, nor in a place too moiſt, for the one or other of thoſe accidents may hurt them; therefore let the place be temperate.</p>
                        <p>18. When you would uſe them and put them into action, hang them upon a nail perpendicular to the Horizon.</p>
                        <p>19. You muſt not think to raiſe a bundle of a great weight, or that has too great a diſproportion to their ſtrength, you muſt adjoyn them together ſo rightly, that all together may have a proper form, and reaſonable to paſs into the Air, and to elevate it ſelf on high without any difficulty, and in ſuch a ſort, that thoſe bundles may not by any means give hinderance or ſtoppage to their riſing in a ſtreight line; and take care moſt exactly that the Fuzee be not ſo big, but that they may retain as near as you can a Pyramidal or Conical form, when all its weight that may be is adjoyned to it.</p>
                        <p>20. Men ought to ſhun as much as poſſible thoſe nights that are rainy, moiſt, and when the Sky is darkned with black clouds, as being very incommodious and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the Fuzees. And more than that, avoid impetuous Stormy winds, and the Whirl-winds hinder no leſs than the firſt.</p>
                        <p>21. You may not reject above other cauſes, the different effects which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſundry Fuzees (although they be charged with one and the ſame Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) no otherwiſe than thus, that they were not made with an equal diligence either in the Charging or Peircing, or in the other Circumſtances, which you were obliged to obſerve; or in this, that it may be ſome may have been kept in a more moiſter place than the others, where they have acquired too much moiſture, which cauſeth to them, effects much different one from another, as well in Riſing as in Conſuming.</p>
                        <p>22. If you would make appear in the Air ſtreams of fire, or a quantity of burning ſparks or ſtars, or long large rayes to dart from the Fuzees; there is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to mix with the Compoſition ſome ſmall quantity of powdered Glaſs groſly beaten, filings of Iron, Sawduſt. One may alſo repreſent fire of divers colours, as we have ſhewed before in the fifth Chapter; but more particularly thus; if you put a certain portion of Camphire in your Compoſition, you will ſee in the Air a certain fire which will appear, white, pale, and of the colour of Milk; if you put Greek Pitch, which is a light yellow Pitch uſed in Plaiſters, called <hi>Pix Burgundy,</hi> it will repreſent unto you a red flame, and of the colour of Braſs; if you put in Sulphur, the fire will appear blew; if Sal-Armoniack, the fire will appear Greeniſh; if from Crude Antimony, the flame will be Red, Yellowiſh, and of the Colour of Honey; if the filings of Ivory be added, they will render a Silver-like, White and ſhining flame, yet ſomething inclining to a Livid Plumbous colour; if the powder of Yellow Amber be added, the fire will appear of the ſame colour, with the Citrine; laſtly, if black Pitch be added, it will throw forth an obſcure ſmoaky fire, or rather a ſmoak that is black and thick, which will darken all the Air.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>FIrſt, take Salt-Peter reduced into fine meal 16 <hi>l.</hi> Sulphur 4 <hi>l.</hi> of the ſawings of wood which hath been firſt boyled in a Nitrous water, and afterwards well dryed, 4 <hi>l.</hi> Of good Corned powder half a pound, of the powder of Ivory 4 ounces.

For that which concerns the manner of preparing all theſe Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it differs nothing from what we have preſcribed in the making of Rockets, only 'tis not neceſſary that the materials be ſo ſubtilly beaten, powdered nor ſifted, as for thoſe <hi>Fuzees,</hi> but nevertheleſs to be well mixed one among another.

                              <hi>Of Stars and fiery Sparks, called by the</hi> Germans Stern-veuer <hi>and</hi> Veuerputzen.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Have ſhewed the Compoſition of Stars in Chap. 5. I have alſo ſhewed the way of making them up, and their uſe, and alſo I have ſhewed the manner of giving to them various Colours, as in the 22 Rule of the 13 Chapter, where I had an intent to ſay no more of theſe things: But finding in Maſter <hi>Cazimier</hi>'s Artillery theſe Compoſitions, which I judge may prove very excellent; therefore I thought good to inſert them, that I might leave out nothing that might make more perfect any thing we treat of.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, you muſt know that between fiery Sparks and Stars there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the Stars are greater, and are not ſo ſoon conſumed by the fire as the Sparks are, but do ſubſiſt longer in the Air; and do ſhine with greater ſubſtance, and with ſuch a light, that by reaſon of their great ſplendor, they are in ſome manner comparable with the Stars in the Heavens. They are prepared according to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Method.</p>
                        <p>Take Salt-Peter half a pound, Sulphur two ounces, Yellow Amber powdered one Dram, Antimony Crude one Dram, of beaten Powder three Drams. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take Sulphur two ounces and a half, Salt-Peter four ounces, Powder ſubtilly powdered four ounces, Olibanum, Maſtick, Chriſtal, Mercury ſublimate, of each four ounces, White Amber one ounce, Camphire one ounce, Antimony and Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment half an ounce; All theſe materials being well beaten and well ſifted, they muſt be mixt together with a little Glue or Gum-water, made with Gum-Arabick or Tragacant; then make them into ſmall Balls about the bigneſs of a Bean or ſmall Nut, which being dryed in the Sun, or in a Pan by the fire, may be kept in a convenient place for ſuch uſes as we have ſpoken of in the fifth Chapter of this Book. You muſt only remember, that when you would put them into Rockets or Recreative Balls, they muſt be covered on all ſides with prepared Tow, of which we have ſhewed the way of preparing in the ſeventh Chapter of the firſt Part of our Fire-works.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes Fire-Maſters are accuſtomed to take in the places of theſe little Balls, a certain proportion of melted matters, of which we have ſpoken in the firſt Part of Fire-works; But if theſe do not pleaſe you, by reaſon of their ſwarthy colour, but you rather deſire to ſee them yellow, or inclining ſomewhat to white, then take of Gum-Arabick or Tragacant four ounces, powder it and paſs it through a Sieve, of Camphire diſſolved in <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> two ounces, Salt-Peter a pound and a half, Sulphur half a pound, Glaſs groſſy powdered four ounces, White Amber an ounce and a half, Orpiment two ounces, make all theſe Ingredients into one maſs, and make Globes of them as before. I Learned this, ſaith my Author, from <hi>Claude Midorge.</hi>

                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:46160:71"/>
                        <p>For the method of making Sparkles in particular, it is thus; Take Salt-Peter one ounce, of this Liquid matter half an ounce, of beaten Powder half an ounce, of Camphire two ounces; after you have beaten all theſe materials into powder, every one by it ſelf, put all of them into an Earthen Pan, and put upon them the Water of Gum Tragacanth, or Brandy-wine, wherein you have diſſolved ſome Gum Tragacanth or Arabick, until it be of a good conſiſtency; that done, take an ounce of Lint, which has firſt been boyled in Brandy-wine or Vinegar, or in Salt-Peter, and after dryed again, and the threads drawn out; then put it into the Compoſition, and mix them well together, ſo well and ſo long until it has drank up all the matter; of theſe Compoſitions make little Balls in the form of Pills, and of the bigneſs of great Peas, which you muſt roul in mealed Gun-powder, and dry them, whereof you may ſerve your ſelf, according to the method we have preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe, there are certain odoriferous Pills prepared, which are employed in ſmall Engines and fiery Inventions, which are ſhewed in Chamber Roams, or cloſe Cabinets, theſe are commonly prepared of Storax, Calamite, Benjamin, Amber, white and yellow, and of Camphire, of each one ounce, Salt-Peter three ounces, of Coals made of the Teil Tree four ounces; beat all theſe Ingredients to powder, then incorporate them well together, and moiſten them with Roſe Water, in which is diſſolved Gum-Arabick or Tragacanth, to make thereof little Balls; at laſt, having faſhioned them, expoſe them to the Sun or to the fire to dry.</p>

                     <p>Again, I ſay, that this <hi>Parabola</hi> is deſcribed by the <hi>Impetus</hi> given; for AE, EF, and EB, or thoſe three lines equal to DG the Altitude, GF the Semi-baſe, and GL are in continual proportion. Wherefore GL is the ſublimity, by the V. Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">De metu Projecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> of <hi>Galiaeus,</hi> and its Corollary.</p>
                     <p>Then thus: the <hi>Impetus</hi> of the <hi>Parabola</hi> AG in the point A, is as much as that of the Cadent naturally falling from L to D, (by X. of <hi>Galiaeus)</hi> that is, from B to A, or of the Project aſcending from A to B: therefore the <hi>Parabola</hi> hath in the point A the <hi>Impetus</hi> that was given: wherefore that is done which was required.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Propoſition is of great moment, for clearing of thoſe that follow, we will prove it another way.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, it is manifeſt that the point P cannot be in the line LD; becauſe ſince the line AC toucheth each <hi>Parabola,</hi> that ID the common <hi>Axis</hi> ſhould be cut into two equal parts in two points by the Vertex's of the <hi>Parabola,</hi> is abſurd.

                     <p>Now let the point P fall any where at pleaſure, and draw the Horizontal line PR: for as much as PN and PM are equal, by the II of * this, NR and RA, PR and RS <note place="margin">Which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime point of the Range of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>[P]</hi> doth cut the Perpendicular <hi>[M]</hi> intercepted betwixt the Horizon and line of direction, into two equal parts.</note> ſhall be equal.

                        <p>2. In the Book of <hi>Galilaeus de motu naturaliter accelerato,</hi> it is proved, that projects thrown with the ſame <hi>Impetus</hi> out of A, if born up by plains of ſeveral incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, do alwayes arrive unto one and the ſame Horizontal plain. But here it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the ſeveral aſcenſions of projects do vary when they are thrown thorough the pure Air, without any fulciment put under them, according to ſeveral elevations. For the moveable ſhall leſs aſcend, which is emitted along the line AB leſs elevated, than that which ſhall be projected along AD more elevated.</p>
                        <p>3. It is manifeſt alſo, that no Altitude can in ſuch ſort aſcend, as that it may reach unto the Horizontal parallel that is drawn thorow E the higheſt point of the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular projection.</p>
                        <p>4. It is alſo manifeſt, that all Amplitudes do alwayes encreaſe from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which is called the point blanck Randon, until you come to the projection made at the Semi-right Angle. And from the Semi-right unto the perpendicular, they alwayes diminiſh until they come to nothing; which hapneth in the perpendicular projection, which hath no Amplitude.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>6. It is manifeſt likewiſe that the Altitudes and Sublimities of projections equi-diſtant from the Semi-right, are reciprocally equal to one another, that is, the Altitude of the one is equal to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of the other.</p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46160:76"/>
                        <p>7. We will therefore make a Corollary of that which to <hi>Galilaeus</hi> was an arduous Theorem, to wit, that the Semi-right <note n="*" place="margin">Or Randon.</note> projection is the greateſt of all thoſe made by the ſame <hi>Impetus.</hi> For, if you ſuppoſe the Angle CAD to be Semi-right, CD ſhall be the Semi-Diameter; that is the greateſt of all the Sines that can be given in the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle.</p>
                        <p>8. It is manifeſt alſo, that the whole Amplitude of the Semi-right <hi>Parabola</hi> is double to the line of the Sublimity, or the <hi>Impetus</hi> AB: for it hath been demonſtrated to be Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple of the right line CD, that is double to AB.</p>

                        <p>I know that its very ſeldom, and perhaps never found, that the greateſt Range of a Piece of Ordnance is juſt thoſe 4000 Paces, as it ſeemeth to have been ſuppoſed in the Calculating of our Table, and alſo in thoſe of <hi>Signiore Galileo,</hi> ſo that the ſaid Table might ſeem unuſeful: but we ſhall ſhew, that the ſuppoſed number of 4000 doth not therefore ſerve to any great particular Machine, to the end it might ſerve to all in general. It is neceſſary therefore to take notice, that that ſame ſuppoſitious Number of 4000, is not of Paces, or of Ells, or of Yards, or of any other determinate meaſure, but of abſtracted parts, ſuch yet, whatever they are, as being convertible into any kinds of poſſible meaſures, they do make the Table general, as well for the Culvering, as for the Mortar-Piece or Croſs-Bow. And to give an example how it may be adapted and applyed to all the Species of Artillery, and how the Abſtract parts may be reduced into Geometrical paces, we will do thus.</p>
                        <p>The greateſt Range of a Canon, by experiment made thereof, is found to be ſuppoſe 2300 paces; and I would with the ſame Piece make a ſhot that ſhould be 860 paces, I do thus: If the greateſt Range 2300 give 860, I ask what the number 1000, the greateſt of the Table will give? I work and find 374: which number being ſought in the Table, is found to be betwixt 370 and 380. Therefore taking the part proportional according to my Judgement, I find the Arch of its Elevation ought to be <hi>Grad.</hi> 11. very near, or its Complement <hi>gr.</hi> 79. And thus it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46160:78"/> that that ſame Piece which being mounted to ſix points did carry 2300 paces. being elevated <hi>gr.</hi> 11. or 79. of the Quadrant, ſhall carry 860 paces, as we did deſire.</p>

                     <p>The Angle of Elevation C A B <hi>gr.</hi> 30, being given, the right Angled Triangle E A C ſhall be given in Specie: and becauſe A B is given in paces, A E ſhall be given, which is the fourth part thereof, namely 600 paces. Let us therefore, to find the quantity of A D, work in this manner by Calculations and Sines.</p>
                     <p>Say, if as the Right Sine 86602 of the Angle A C E, <hi>gr.</hi> 60. that is, of the Complement of the Elevation, is to the ſide A E, which is 600: ſo is the whole Sine 100000 to a fourth number 693: and thus the Hypothenuſe A C ſhall be 693 Paces. But becauſe that the right angled Triangle A C D is given in Specie, begin again and ſay, as the right Sine 50000 of the angle A D C, which is equal to the angle given of the Elevation E A C, is to the right Line A C, which is found to be 693 paces, ſo is the whole line to a fourth number 1386. And thus the right line ſought A D, ſhall be 1386 paces. But becauſe A D, being the line of <hi>Impetus</hi> or Sublimity, is equal to half the greateſt Range; if we double 1386, we ſhall make the number of 2772 paces; for ſo much ſhall be the length of the deſired greateſt Range of that Gun, which being elevated to the Randon of <hi>gr.</hi> 30, is found to carry 2400 paces.</p>
                     <p>But with much more brevity, and at one ſingle working, we may perform the ſame thus. Suppoſe the whole Sine to be C F, then F A and F D ſhall be the Taugents, one, of the angle of elevation, and the other of its Complement. Say, therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e as the whole Sine is to C F, which is 600: ſo is 230940 (which is the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46160:79"/> ſum of both thoſe Tangents) to a fourth number 1386. And thus the right line AD is found, as before, 1386 paces: which being doubled, will give the meaſure of the Semirect, or greateſt * Randon, as you well call it. <note place="margin">Or the beſt of the Randon.</note>

                     <p>But when from the point A it is required to ſhoot downwards by a deſcending Hill, as AB, we ſhall find the quantity of the Range AB, that is, the place where the Ball falleth, in this manner. Let the direction AE, that is, let the angle of the Pieces Elevation be given; alſo let there be given the angle of the Hills inclination CAB. Let us imagine the Horizon to be AC, and let us draw BE and HDF perpendiculars to the ſame: and conjoyn or draw a line from C to H, which line ſhall be parallel to AE. Now upon the Table of Amplitudes we ſhall find how many paces AD is, but we ſeek the quantity of AB. Therefore make the calculation thus; as FD the Tangent of the angle of the Pieces Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to DH, the Tangent of the inclination of the plain; ſo is AD, known in paces, to a farther number. And this ſhall be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of DC in paces; and thus the whole line AC ſhall be known in paces. Then ſay again, as AC the whole Sine is to AC known in paces, ſo it AB the a fourth number: and this laſt number ſhall be the meaſure ſought of the right line AB in paces; that is, the length of the Range upon the deſcending plain AB. It happeneth alſo many times, that we are to ſhoot at plains perpendicular to the Horizon, as at the Walls of Cities, or Towers, or other wayes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo in this caſe we will ſubjoyn the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for finding the Altitude of that point in the ſaid Wall where the Ball is to hit.</p>

                     <p>Let the Direction of the Piece be the Line AB, and the Horizon AC, and the Wall of the Tower DE perpendicular to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: and let the diſtance AD be known in paces. Let us ſuppoſe that the Ball paſſeth freely without hitting the Wall, and falleth upon the Horizon in C. The Table of the Amplitudes giveth the quantity of AC, but we ſeek the Altitudes DE. Draw CB per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the Horizon, and DF parallel to AB, and then draw a line from F to A, which ſhall paſs thorow the common Section of the <hi>Parabola,</hi> and of the Wall, as may be collected from the things already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. Now ſay, as CA the length of the Horizontal line is to CD the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the lines AC and AD already known, ſo is BC the Tangent of the angle of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Piece, to CF the Tangent of the angle FAC. Again ſay, as the Sine Total is to AD known in paces, ſo is the laſt found Tangent of the angle FAC to a fourth number: which ſhall be the deſired meaſure of the right line DE in paces. And thus we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46160:80"/> have found the point E in which the ſaid ſhot would ſtick. The ſame calculation may be alſo deduced.

                     <head>Of the Quadrant.</head>
                     <p>LEt us now come to practice; and by help of an Inſtrument, let us reſolve ſome of the Propoſitions above demonſtrated. We will make a Military Quadrant, which with invariable certainty ſheweth (at leaſt to Geometrical Philoſophers, if not to practical Gunners) what Mounture or Elevation ought to be given to any Piece, to the end that the length of the Range may prove to be of ſuch a certain meaſure. We will alſo reſolve, by help hereof, all Problems that can be framed about the ſhooting of Artillery, which were heretofore promiſed by <hi>Tartaglia,</hi> and reduced into Tables by <hi>Galileo,</hi> with ſomething over and above. Military Induſtry did find that the uſe of a Machine ſo noble, and of ſo great conſequence as the Canon, would be too much confined, and of too little benefit, if it could not be made uſe of ſave only at that ſmall diſtance to which it carrieth a point blank, or in its level Range, without giving it with the Quadrant the advantageous aſſiſtance of ſome elevation. It was therefore enquired how a man might do that with the ſame Piece, which of it ſelf did not carry more than 200 or 250 Geometrical paces, he might ſhoot 400 and alſo 600 paces, and more and more, until he come to the length of the greateſt Range that can be made by that Piece. The Invention was thus: They began to help the Piece by Elevation, that is, they directed it not ſtraight upon th' object which it was to hit, but, holding it in the very vertical of th' object, they elevated it above that right line which goeth from the Piece unto the object: and this they did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and ſometimes leſs, according as the force of the Shot was to be greater or leſſer: An Artifice that from the very beginning of the world hath been known even to artleſs Boyes. We ſee that when they with a Ball of Snow, or other matter, do aim to hit a mark that is very near, they throw it directly at the mark: but being at another time to aim at one which ſtandeth farther off, or being to throw Stones at each other, they do not throw Horizontally, or directly at their Adverſaries, but turning the caſt half way into the Air, without having ever had any other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they do all throw at the elevation of the fifth, and alſo of the ſixth point of the Military Square to them unknown: But Gunners, in proceſs of time, have found an Inſtrument, that doth with facility meaſure theſe Elevations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nicolo Tartaglia</hi> of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> a famous Mathematician, did invent a Square with unequal ſides joyned together with the Quadrant, which hath for more than a hundred years paſt, been generally uſed, and is ſtill the only Regulator of Gunners, not only to manage great Guns, and to raiſe them to thoſe Mountures which they call Randons, but alſo to level them in the Point-blank Ranges; <hi>Tartaglia</hi> divided that Quadrant into 12 equal parts, beginning the Numeration of them from the leſſer [or ſhorter] ſide; he alſo ſubdivided each of thoſe into other 12 equal parts, naming thoſe firſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46160:82"/> Points, and theſe ſecond Minutes of the Quadrant. We will inſert the figure of the Quadrant, and ſhew how it meaſureth the Elevation [Mounture or Randon] of the Piece.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>quadrant measuring an angle</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>By the help of this Quadrant Gunners have with long obſervations compoſed ſuch a <hi>Praxis,</hi> as that they know how many points they are to mount <hi>v. gr.</hi> a Culvering of 40 pound Ball to hit a mark diſtant; for example, 700 Geometrical paces, or at any other diſtance.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, the obſervations are ſo ſallible, and the Gunners ſo few that have made them, and made them exactly, that the uſe of Artillery, taking from it the Range of Point Blank, muſt needs have very little of certainty in it.</p>
                     <p>If one would collect ſome certain Science touching th' ordinary Quadrant, it would be neceſſary to make the Experiments not only with all ſorts of Balls, and with all the varieties of Powder, but in all kind of Pieces, as alſo in all thoſe that being the ſame <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> are of different grandeur; and laſtly, at all poſſible degrees of Elevation. A Multiplication that almoſt runs up into infinity. And we obſerve that theſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments ought to be all made one by one; for it is not true, that by way of proportion one may from three or four Ranges of a Canon made at ſeveral elevations, argue to any others, no not of the ſame Canon, laden with the ſame Powder and Ball. That this is ſo, may be demonſtrated by help of the Tables made by <hi>Signiore Galilaeo,</hi> and by us. For example, That Canon which being elevated at the ſixth Point, curryeth its ſhot 4000 paces, elevated at one Point, ought to curry the ſixth part, at two points the third, and at three points the half of that Range. But the thing falls out far otherwiſe: For being elevated to one point, it curryeth 1032 inſtead of 666, which is the ſixth part of that ſame greateſt Range 4000: at the ſecond point (and note that with this Mounture, Pieces carry alwayes the half of the greateſt Range) in our caſe will curry 2000 in ſtead of 1333, which is the third part: At the third point it will curry 2824, inſtead of 2000, which is the half of the greateſt Range: at the fourth point it will curry 3464 inſtead of 2666: At the fifth point it will curry 3860, in ſtead of 2333, which are 5 ſixths of that greateſt Range: See therefore how that increaſing equally the Mountures of the Piece, that is ſhooting firſt at one point only, then at two, three, four, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto the ſixth, the increaſes of the lengths of the Ranges do not increaſe equally, that is with the ſame proportion wherewith the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46160:82"/>
* Randons increaſe. But the firſt point currying 1032, the ſecond increaſeth above it <note place="margin">Or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> 968, the third increaſeth 824, the fourth 640, the fifth 396, the ſixth 140. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to derive ſome rule from the Experiments, it were neceſſary to make them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, at all the Grades of Randons, in all ſorts of Pieces, with all varieties of Powders, and different matters of Balls; and happily one might ſay, it were neceſſary alſo that every Gunner made them by himſelf. Things almoſt impoſſible to reduce unto Rules, from which any certainty might be gathered, if the Theorick and Geometry had not given us a manifeſt Science thereof, by means of that one ſole Propoſition of <hi>Galileo,</hi> in which firſt of all men he hath advertiſed and taught us, <hi>That Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ects do all move in a Parabolical Line.</hi> Upon this ſuppoſition we will ground the Inſtrument promiſed: and though by the impediment of the <hi>medium</hi> the <hi>Parabola's</hi> become too deformed, or by many other accidents the Ranges prove very inconſtant, yet it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us to have given indubitable ſatisfaction to the School of Mathematicians, if not to that of Gunners.</p>
                     <p>Before we ſet down the making of our ſquare, which conſiſteth only in deſcribing one ſingle Semi-circle, we will divide the ordinary Quadrant into unequal points, ſo as they may not meaſure the Randons of the Piece, but the lengths of the Ranges, which is that that ſerves to our purpoſe. Thus we ſhall be aſſured, that the Gun, if it ſhall be elevated to one point of the ſaid Quadrant, ſhall carry to ſuch a diſtance, whatever it be: and elevated to two points, ſhall preciſely double that Range: and if to three, it ſhall carry three of thoſe ſpaces; if to four and a half, it ſhall carry four and a half; if to five and a quarter, it ſhall carry five and a quarter; and thus until you come to the ſixth point, ſhall the points of the Quadrant in the Inſtrument, and the ſpaces of the Ranges in the Field, alwayes increaſe in the ſame manner, and with the ſame proportion, and from the ſixth to the twelfth point, they ſhall go in the ſame manner decreaſing. The conſtruction and demonſtration is Geometrically taken from the propoſition which we have made the Firſt of this our Book of Projects, which by the Amplitude given, teacheth us to find the Elevation. And it ſerveth in common for whatſoever ſort of Artillery and Mortar Pieces, and for any ſort of Ball or Powder.</p>

The <hi>Praxis</hi> is this; I deſire to know how far the ſixth point carrieth, I thus ſay, If five points give 2000 paces, how much ſhall ſix points give? and I find 2400 paces.

                        <p>And take notice by the way, that inſtead of performing this operation with the points 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, It may be done with their Complements, which are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.</p>

Let us now demonſtrate Geometrically, that this ſquare is convenient to meaſure, with exceeding plainneſs, the lengths and the Altitudes of the Ranges, the times of their Durations, the ſublimities of the <hi>Parabola</hi>'s, and the Elevations of the Pieces. And then we will ſet down the Diviſion of the Lines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, without the need of any Table for the uſing of the ſame.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>That this is ſo, ſhall thus be demonſtrated (having reference to the I. propoſition of Projects, and its Corollaries.) Let the line of the direction A B I be prolonged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, as alſo the perpendicular T B L; then by imagination take B L of ſuch a length, that it may be really equal to half the greateſt Range of our preſent Piece. And about the Diameter B L, let there be imaginarily drawn the great Semi-circle B I L; cutting the Circumference B I in any point I; and draw the Horizontal line I M. It is manifeſt, by the afore-cited Propoſ. I. of Projects, that the line M I ſhall be the real fourth part of the length of the Range; as alſo, that D M ſhall be the (not imiginary, but real Altitude of the ſaid Range; and ſo the other meaſures in the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle B I L, ſhall be all true and real. Now obſerve, that the Triangle H B F is like to the Triangle B I M, as being right-angled, and having two angles at the Point B. Therefore the ſame Propoſition ſhall be between all the ſmall and imaginary meaſures of the ſquare A C, as is between all the true meaſures in the imaginary and great Semi-circle B I L; that is, the lines, A B, B F, F H and H B, ſhall be to one another in the ſame proportion reſpectively as L B, B I, I M, and M B. Therefore, as to arguing in the proportions, we may without any error, as well make uſe of thoſe feigned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions upon the ſquare, as of the true ones, imagined in the Amplitude of the Air.</p>
                        <p>It remains now that we ſhew how this Doctrine, which hath hitherto been a meer Speculation, may now reduced to Manual practice, and that with facility. Every one ſeeth that for our obtaining knowledge of the quantity of the lines A B, B F, F H, and H B, and their proportions in the precedent Figure, it would be neceſſary that all the aforeſaid lines were divided into moſt Minute parts with ſome common meaſure. To this purpoſe, therefore, we will divide the Diameter A B, and Semi-Diameter E D, into equal and very ſmall parts, as appeareth in the following Figure; (upon which let us deſcribe the imaginary ſquare) and then let us give to each diviſion of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46160:84"/> the circumference, its guides parallel to thoſe Diameters, that ſo in them the number and quantity of the lines which ſhall be Indices of the length and Altitudes of the Ranges, may be read or found: And in the point of the angle of Semi-circle B, place the Thread and Plummet.</p>
                        <p>As to the number of parts into which the Diameter A B is to be divided, it ſhall be left to the choice of every one; but yet it will be convenient to make choice of the number 2000, for that it will facilitate the Arithmetical operation.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted, that if any one will make a ſquare, as hath been ſaid, on purpoſe for one kind of Artillery onely, he ſhall without the leaſt trouble of Calculation, have the meaſures of all its Ranges.</p>
                        <p>The Diviſion of this ſquare is to be made <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> in this manner. Make an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the greateſt Range of that ſame Piece to which you would have the ſquare to be adapted, and let it be found <hi>v. gr.</hi> to be 3000. Then divide the Diameter of the ſquare into 1500 parts, and the perpendicular Semi-diameter into 750 equal parts; that is, imagine that the Diameter A B 1500, is the half of the greateſt Range 3000; as alſo, that the perpendicular Semi-diameter E D 750, is the fourth part of that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Range. And thus, every of the other Elevations being afterwards given, as ſoon as we ſhall apply this Square to the Muzzle of the Piece, we ſhall immediately ſee how many paces is the length, and how many the Altitude of the Range, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this ſquare made <hi>v. gr.</hi> for a Canon of 60 pound Ball, would be alſo good for every other Canon of 60 pound Ball, that ſhould be the ſame in length, and other proportions, with that.</p>
                        <p>It's true indeed, that if we would make the ſquare univerſal, to ſerve indifferently for all Species and Magnitudes of Artillery, we muſt then do thus. Divide the Diameter A B in the precedent figure in 2000 equal parts: alſo let the Semi-Diameter E D be divided into 1000 equal parts, (we by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of the figure have divided it only into 100, taking the parts by ten and ten.) This done, let there be drawn by the Diviſions of the Circumference, cut into equal degrees, as is uſual, the guides parallel unto the Diameters, that ſo one may upon thoſe Diameters read or find the quantity of the right lines, as they ſhall happen to be.</p>

                        <p>If you deſire the Altitudes, and not the lengths of Ranges, then make the ſame work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before, but not with the lines I O and M L, which give the lengths, but with H O and H L, which give the Altitudes. And if we would have the ſublimities, it would be neceſſary to work with G O and G L. But, which more importeth, if any one after the previous Experiment hath been made, ſhall deſire that the ſame Piece may make an aſſigned Range, in length, <hi>v. gr.</hi> 2200 paces,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46160:84"/> we are to find what elevation ought to be given to the Piece. Work thus: If the 1250 paces of the previous Experiment give I O numbred, what ſhall the 2200 paces give? and you ſhall find a number, which ſuppoſe for example, to be aſcribed on the ſquare unto the line M L. the Peice Therefore is to be raiſed to ſuch a Randon, that the thread may paſs thorow the point M; and then the Range ſhall be 2200 paces.</p>
                        <p>The times or durations of the Ranges are given by the Lines H I and H M: and to find the Quantity of theſe it may be done two wayes. Firſt, by way of calculation: For the ſquare of the time H I (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Figure) is alwayes equal to the two ſquares of the Altitude H O, and of the fourth part of the length I O. Secondly, by making to all the Diviſions of the Perifry B, C, D, (in the preſent Figure) from the Center A the circular guides B E, C F, D H: for A H being thus divided into very ſmall equal parts, it ſhall meaſure all the right lines, A B, A C, and A D, which are the times of the Ranges.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoſoever would try the ſwiftneſs of Sounds by night, and by day, either in valleys, woods, or mountains, either with or againſt the wind, or when it is rainy or fair weather, ſhall find in all reſpects as I have tried it, that there will be alwayes the ſame ſwiftneſs of Sound.</p>
                  <p>But after that you have ſearched out a ſecond by 230 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, he that ſhoots off a leſſer Gun, may again retire 230 fathoms, ſo that he may be gone back from you 460 fathoms, the ſame or the like Sound in paſſing over that way will ſpend two ſeconds; which when it ſhall be five times multiplied by us, that we ſhould hear the Sound 1150 fathoms, the flaſh by night breaking forth from the mouth of the Gun is alwayes ſeen at that diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sound is heard five ſeconds of time. And ſeeing we make a <hi>French</hi> league to be 2500 fathoms, and the circuit of the Earth 7200, of ſuch leagues, you may eaſily conclude in what time the ſound does paſs over one whole or ſeveral leagues, for the ſwiftneſs of the ſound is not diminiſhed by its debility, whenas the laſt part of the Sound that may be heard does emulate the ſwiftneſs of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Sound of the Gun therefore will paſs over a league in the ſpace of 11 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, ſeeing a league contains 11 times 230 fathoms (the ſpace paſſed over in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond minute) leſs onely by 30 fathoms, which are here ſcarce worth conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe that they are paſſed over by the Sound in the ſeventh part of a ſecond.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:46160:89"/>
                  <p>From which many things may be gathered; firſt, that a Souldier attentive my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or ſhun the ſhot of a Gun at one hundred fathoms, is he foreſaw the flaſh of it; which I thus demonſtrate: It is evident from obſervation, that a Bullet in flying 100 fathoms does at the leaſt ſpend a ſecond of time, and the Sound of it in paſſing of them does at the moſt ſpend but half a ſecond. Therefore the Souldier from the fire ſeen (if Viſion can be in an inſtant) hath a whole ſecond wherein he my eaſily go three or four paces before that the bullet can fly ſo far; alſo there remains to him half a ſecond from that point of time in which he hears the Sound, until the coming of the Bullet: although I would not adviſe any one to try that, unleſs he firſt fortifie himſelf with a ſhield, helmet, and all other kind of Armour, that he may be out of all danger. But any one may try it behind a wall, to which the Sound will come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bullet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the Sound and fire obſerved, may be known how much the Guns are diſtant that are ſhot off againſt the beſieged, or beſiegers, even as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gunners there will not be wanting matter to promote their Art.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by hearing the Sound of Thunder, and ſeeing the lightning go before may be known how far it is off, ſo that if the Thunder be not changed from the place where the lightning was ſeen; for how many ſeconds (whether meaſured by the pulſe, which exactly continues a ſecond, or by a Pendulum or any other Watch) there are between the Lightning and the Sound, ſo many 230 fathoms are to be reckoned; ſo that if you number five ſeconds it may be diſtant from you half a league; if ten ſeconds a whole league, whether the diſtance ſhall be upright, or ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and oblique, for it matters nothing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If by the turnings and windings or Circles in the air a ſound in the ſame manner may be conſidered, and cauſed, as we ſee circles extende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the water ſtruck with the finger or a little ſtone, as all almoſt believe, and if from the ſwiftneſs of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in like manner moved we my gheſs at their craſſitude, thickneſs and weight, we may ſay that water is 1380 times thicker and heavier than air; for as much as the Semidiameter of Circles of the Water in any manner ſtruck, which is made in a ſecond of time, ſcarce exceeds a foot, in which time the ſemidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amiter of Circles in the air, made alſo by any percuſſion is 1380 foot, that is 230 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms; which proportion of gravities come very near to obſervations by him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. There is yet one thing that may cauſe ſome doubt, which is, that the Sound of greater Guns moves more ſlowly than of leſſer, whereas our Geometer in the ſiege at <hi>Theodonis</hi> obſerved that their Sound was heard, from the fire ſeen, after thirteen or fourteen ſeconds of time, when yet he was ſcarce half a league diſtant from thoſe Guns; And the Sound according to that which hath been before ſaid, may paſs over a whole league and more in that time: Wherefore the Sound of thoſe Guns doth ſeem to be different from that of leſſer Guns.</p>
                  <p>The Author having by this diſcourſe argued that the Sound of Guns is heard at the diſtance of above 16 miles a minute (which is almoſt as ſwift as the <hi>Copernicans</hi> ſuppoſe the Earth to move in its diurnal revolution about its Axis) it was thought fit to ſubjoyn hereto the Authors latter thoughts of the ſame Argument, publiſhed three years after.</p>

                  <head>OF THE SWIFTNESS OF SOUND, And force of Bullets ſhot out of Guns.</head>
                  <p>WHen I have oftentimes conſidered that the Sound paſſes over 230 fathoms in the time of a 2d or ſixtieth part of a minute; and that there ſeem to ariſe ſomeed doubt, whether there ſhould be that Swiftneſs of the Sound of greater Guns, as there is of leſſer, with which I tried; at length it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that in the ſpace of eleven ſeconds, the Sound of the greater Guns of the Kings Armory, have paſſed from the ſame Armory, after the flaſh was ſeen, as far as our houſe, or the <hi>Vicennian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, whilſt for obtaining the ſurrender of <hi>Pouploon</hi> the Guns were ſhot off by night.</p>
                  <p>But when with a fathom I found that it was 3524 fathoms from Port Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> to the gate of the aforeſaid Convent, where the ear was, and to the wall of the <hi>Vicennian</hi> Caſtle firſt meeting it, near 2500 fathoms, 'tis certain firſt that it is a juſt league of 2500 fathoms from the Garden walk of the Armoty, from whence the Guns are wont to be ſhot off, to that Caſtle: for if any thing in the paſſage muſt be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that diſtance will well enough equal it, whereby the corner of the Garden is more diſtant, or the walk by <hi>Sequana</hi> nearer from the Caſtle, than Port Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is evident therefore that the Sound runs over more than 230 Fathoms in each ſecond, to wit, 320 in every ſecond, which make 1920 foot; which ſince any one can prove by his own experiments, I need not ſay more thereof.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may imagine that hence perhaps muſt be concluded that greater Sounds paſs more ſwiftly, which diſagrees with divers obſervations. But when ſometimes theſe experiments ſhall be repeated, that I may number the ſeconds, I ſhall advertiſe, for as much as I conjecture that there is no ſwiftneſs of ſound greater than that, which I have proved of 230 fathoms for a ſecond; for in theſe ſmall matters I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that common ſaying, He that acts by another, ſeems to act by himſelf; who want not opportunities may obſerve for their own ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But now we ſhall add ſome thing concerning the ſwiftneſs of Bullets ſhot out of Guns. When therefore at the Marqueſſe of <hi>Doraiſons</hi> four leagues from the <hi>Sexti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> waters, I commanded a Braſſe Gun nine foot long, whoſe name was the <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> commonly called <hi>la Marquiſe,</hi> (whoſe Bullet was two pounds and an ounce, but quantity of Powder, ſuch as is wont to be in the uſe of leſſer Guns, the weight of one pound) to be levelled horizontally, with a plum line I found that the Bullet ſhot off Horizonitally, in the time of five ſeconds had paſſed over 630 fathoms or 3780 foot, and had reached the horizon, or fell to the ground, as was evident by the huge quantity of duſt raiſed by the blow.</p>
                  <p>Moreover that point of Earth which was firſt ſtruck by the Bullet was depreſſed under the horizon of the Gun 27 fathoms, for otherwiſe the Range ſhould not have been ſo great before its fall to the earth, which meets ſo much the more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by how much it is the more depreſſed under the Horizon of the Gun ſhot off, and I preſume I have attributed a leſſer ſwiftneſs to the Guns than is juſt, unleſs yet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46160:90"/> the Bullets of the greater Guns ſhot off with very fine powder, which we uſed, may exceed the ſwiftneſs of Bullets ſhot from Harquebuzes; of which thing I do not yet paſs judgement, till experiment, ſhall bring ſome further evidence: but I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome things newly obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore of the Bullet which I made trial of, I affirm that the ſwiftneſs was ſo great that, at leaſt, in each ſecond minute it could paſs over 126 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, at leaſt, becauſe the obſervers know that the force on the Bullet doth go before the excuſſion or flaſh of the powder, and the perceiving thereof; ſo that half a ſecond may well be attributed to this time. Moreover in the firſt ſecond the Bullet paſſes more ſwiftly, in which time I doubt not but it paſſes over 150 fathoms; Laſtly, if by reaſon of that tarrying which. happens betwen the ſmiting of the Earth until the duſt is ſeen to riſe, we ſhould augment that ſwiftneſs by ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms as it could paſs over in half a minute, to wit 70, and that the ſwiftneſs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed almoſt equal for the time of five ſeconds, and in each ſecond of that time that it paſſes over 140 fathoms, that is, if the point of the Earth firſt ſtruck were 700 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms diſtant from the Gun, it would reach it in the time of five ſeconds. Then the ſwiftneſs of the Bullet may be determined from what hath been ſaid, to be 130 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, at leaſt, in the time of a ſecond: which alſo agrees with the experiments of Bullets ſhot from leſſer Guns: to wit, they paſs an hundred fathoms in the ſame time as the Sound of the Gun hath the ſame paſſage.</p>
                  <p>For if, behind a wall that is to be ſtruck by the Bullet, the ear be attentive, in the ſame inſtant the ſound and the percuſſion of the Bullet is heard, as if the very Bullet had cauſed that Sound; which doubtleſs you ſhall find to be true as I did if you try: although it will be worth the labour to prove it, not only with that moſt refined powder, which they are wont to uſe who ſhoot at a mark for a wager, but alſo with the courſer ſort of Powder for great Guns, that it may be obſerved whether it cauſes any ſenſible difference of the ſwiftneſs.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever powder you uſe, the leaſt ſwiftneſs of the Bullet, may be defined in the firſt ſecond an hundred, the greateſt 150 fathoms, if you but ſo much Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the Gun as is neceſſary for a good ſhot; for if you put in but a few grains which can ſcarce ſhoot the Bullet off, another thing. is to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I add that a Bullet ſhot vertically or Perpendicularly upright from the aforeſaid Gun in its aſcent and deſcent, ſpends 36 ſeconds: which if it ſpend ſo much time in its Riſe as in its fall, and that a heavy body deſcending in the time of 18 ſeconds alwayes keeps the ſame proportion in haſtening its deſcent which it keeps in the four firſt ſeconds, the Vertical aſcent ſhall be 648 fathoms, foraſmuch as a Bullet of ſix pound Weight of that Gun, which the Illuſtrious Knight <hi>Hugenius</hi> cauſed to be ſhot off at the <hi>Hague</hi> upon my requeſt, in its aſcent in the time of 16 ſeconds paſſed over 512 fathoms, which falling, pierced three foot into the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But two things there are which may leſſen the ſpace of the aſcent; firſt, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the bullet may not ſpend ſo much time in its aſcent as in its deſcent, becauſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in aſcending paſs over the ſame way in three ſeconds of time that in deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do in five ſeconds: furthermore ſhould we imagine to ſhoot with the mouth of the Gun towards the Earth, the Bullet would pierce deeper into the Earth, than by its mere fall, as it happens in Arrows: whence there ariſes in me no ſmall ſuſpicion that the eyes in the aſcent of the Bullet are deceived, to wit that the Bullet was even falling when it was yet eſteemed to aſcend: which alſo may be imagined of Arrows, which perhaps had began to deſcend when they ſhould ſeem to be inverted, that the point which went before aſcending ſhould likewiſe deſcending antecede: which you may conclude of from the ſmall blow of the Bullet deſcending, unleſs you may contend that the ſtroke made by the Bullet ſhot upright from the mouth of the Gun and falling upon the Earth very near, is greater indeed than the ſtroke of the ſame Bullet ſhot from the greateſt height, and that not by reaſon of the greater ſwiftneſs, but by reaſon of the air ſo unawares intercepted and oppreſſed, that it may much
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46160:90"/> better turn over or bore through the Earth, than when it is prepared for the laſt motion by the Bullet falling ſlowly.</p>
                  <p>Which indeed can be known by Rocks and Mountains 600 fathoms high, to wit, one ſtanding on the top ſhall obſerve what time the Bullet that is ſhot off at the foot of the Mountain, ſhall ſpend in coming to the top or any other place of the Mountain, and a fign being given ſhall warn the leveller of the Gun of the time, or from it ſhall learn the time of the aſcent and deſcent: from which cutting off the time of the aſcent ſhall conclude how much ſhorter it ſhall be in the time of the deſcent; which alſo may be obſerved by an iron Bullet red-hot ſhot off in the night, whilſt it can be ſeen light to the greateſt height: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is I think fit to add the obſervation of that Holland Gun, which being levelly or horizontally ſhot off, carried a Bullet of ſix pounds 398 paces, before it firſt touched the Earth, taking a pace for three foot; after this Space it made eight leaps, and at length it ceaſed at 1750 paces: we have here expreſſed the diſtance between each leap, as likewiſe the diſtance of each grazing from the Gun.</p>

                  <p>Moreover a middle range of 45 degrees was 3225 paces, whoſe half if we take it for an upright or vertical ſhot, will be 3225 foot, or 537 ½ fathoms, for which before we counted only 512. Hence it comes to paſs that we may judge that a vertical ſhot in the aſcent doth not proceed by the ſame or equal and proportionable degrees of ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by which it falls in its deſcent, for at leaſt there are wanting 25 fathoms, by which 512 differ from 537, although that way of him that levelled the Gun, in counting by common paces, reſtrained to no rule, cannot be ſo certain, but that the other may differ from it, ſo that it cannot with undoubted certainty be reduced to our defined fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.</p>
                  <p>Whoever therefore would certainly try, let him have a chain or wheel for counting of fathoms or any other determinate meaſures, as is done in the paſſage of the league of 2500 fathoms from the <hi>Baſtilian</hi> Tower erected right over againſt Port Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> as for as the walls of the <hi>Vicennian</hi> Caſtle that firſt meet.</p>
                  <p>There remaines one thing that may diminiſh the upright height, to wit, that the Bullet ſpends more ſeconds in the deſcent than it ought, after it comes to the point of equality, after which it doth not any more augment its own ſwiftneſs: ſo that not only 16 ſeconds are to be reckoned for the deſcent of the Holland Bullet, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 20, and 12 are to be counted for the aſcent.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:46160:91"/>
                  <p>For although in moderate heights of 40 or 50 fathoms, the acceſs to the point of equality, in leaden Bullets may not be ſufficiently obſerved, it does not thence follow that it comes not to ſuch a point, in greater heights of an hundred or more fathoms; yea experience proveth the Contrary.</p>
                  <p>Let there be taken a Corken. Bullet which is at leaſt 70 times lighter than a leaden one, yet both them almoſt in the ſame time make a three foot ſpace, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Corke attains its point of equality within 50 foot.</p>
                  <p>But whether a leaden Bullet 70 times heavier, can paſs over a ſeventy fold ſpace, that is, 3500 foot, before it comes to its point of equality, which little differs from the height to which Bullets arrive that are vertically ſhot out of Guns, although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet conclude, yet it ſeemes probable enough to me. Moreover the force will never be augmented after the arival at that point, if the greater force ſhall be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from only the greater ſwiftneſs. But note, it hath been obſerved by a Noble man who related it to me, that a field Gun 18 foot long, and cut ſhorter foot by foot, did alwaies curry its ſhott the further till it came to be eleven foot long, and then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not to give ſo great a Range.</p>
                  <p>To which may be added from the experience of ſome in ſmall Guns, that if it be over charged with Powder, part of the Powder will blow out of the Gun without firing. Morever if the Bullet be not quite remmed home it will pierce the further, and the Gun recoyle the more.</p>
                  <p>Alſo that where the Gun is found moſt to furr with many ſhootings off with Powder, there it ought to be cut off, the remainder being the proper length requiſite.</p>
                  <p>It hath been related that a ſhip becalmed and tormented with the Cuſhee Piece of a Galley, that lay in a manner out of ſhot, was at the laſt reached by the induſtry of a Mariner, who wrapping up a much leſſer ſized Bullet than the Bore of the Gun made uſe of required, in a good Wad did ſhoot as far as the Galley, thereby retaliating the Injury received.</p>

                     <head>Of the Depreſſion of ſhot below the Marke.</head>
                     <p>I Have often took care that a Gun ſhould be ſhot off commonly called an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuz, at the ſpace of an hundred fathoms from the mark, that is, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot, which make three hundred common paces, and found that the Bullet was depreſſed under the mark-line eight or ten foot, which would ſcarce have made a greater ſpace, if it had fallen perpendicularly down at the ſame moment of time it was left off.</p>
                     <p>Again at the the Marqueſs of <hi>Doraiſons,</hi> a Bullet ſhot off, in the ſpace of five ſeconds of time fell 27 fathoms beneath its horizontal line or marke; and whereas perchance the riſing of the duſt, and the perceiving of it might make us loſe a ſecond of time, and that we retain only four ſeconds, then in each ſecond the Bullet ſhould be carried 157 ½ fathoms (ſurely not more) yet it ought to have deſcended 32 fathoms, if it deſcends ſo much horizontally ſhot off as it would naturally fall were it not ſhot off, and therefore it either loſes ſome thing of its deſcent by reaſon of its being ſhot off, or in running 360 fathoms, it ſpends not ſo much as four whole ſeconds of time, but rather about 3 ¾.</p>
                     <p>We add that ſomething is by this means abated from the ſwiftneſs of the fall for the ſpace of 27 fathoms which the Bullet in ſhooting off did deſcend, or fall below the marke: ſo that all things conſidered, I would not as yet ſtart from that opinion, which holds that two heavy bodies, to wit, two Bullets, whereof one may fall perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly from its place above the Horizon, and the other be forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">

                     <p>But note that the air that meets the bullet that is ſhot off does ſo much hinder or diminiſh its motion, as much as a wind of the ſame ſwiftneſs with the Ball, blowing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually againſt the ſame in a vacuum.</p>
                     <p>For is it not the ſame impediment, or deſtruction of the ſame force, if the bullet beats the aire or is beaten of it?

                     <p>IN regard that Bullets ſhot from Guns do about the end of their motion utter a more vehement noiſe or hiſſing than about the middle or onwards; there is no doubt to be made but that they move more ſlowly, and the force decreaſing as the ſwiftneſs, <hi>Merſennus</hi> concludes that the Curved range line deſcribed by a Bullets mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot exactly deſcribe a Parabola, but however the Theory is tolerable, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt violence to move in the touch line of a Parobola, and it is likely the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mountures cauſe the greateſt difference, becauſe, there is ſo much the more Air beaten and removed by the paſſage of the ſhot.</p>
                     <p>But yet it is moſt hard to find out, how much the Air hinders; for although it ſeems to hinder ſo much, as the wind agitating the air with the ſame ſwiftneſs, ſtrikes upon the Bullet ſhot off; yet we are Ignorant of the force of that wind compared with the force of the Bullet ſhot off; unleſs we may appeale to our other experiments in which is ſhewn that the air is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Which being ſuppoſed it may be Theorically concluded, how great the ſhoots ought to be at whatſoever elevation above the horizon, if they be in ſuch Proportion one to another, as ſhots in a Vacuity, no Medium hindring; that is, for example, if the range of 45 degrees be double the height of the Perpendicular or vertical ſhot in a ſpace not hindring, ſo is the range of 45 in the air to the vertical in the air, and ſo of the reſt; which obſervations only will teach; which yet are moſt difficult in the greater ſort of Guns or Bows, eſpecially the perpendicular, whoſe height we can ſcarce certainly know, unleſs ſome rock might be found high enough, to whoſe top, or ſome certain place, the Bullet or Arrow may come, the height of which top or place we may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards meaſure.</p>
                     <p>No Towers ſurely are high enough; and by the time of the deſcent or fall of the Bullet, to conclude a place may be found to which bullets, darts, or other things that are caſt upright or vertically aſcending, do come, doth therefore fail, becauſe they do not obſerve the ſame rule of ſwiftneſs in deſcending; as is evident from darts, to which ſeeing it happens in their aſcent or riſe of 50 fathoms to be ſlackned in their deſcent or fall, ſomething like this may be alſo thought to happen to Bullets, to wit, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the height of a thouſand fathoms.</p>

                     <head>The Ranges of Spouts or Squirts compared with the Ranges of Bullets ſhot out of Guns.</head>
                     <p>FOr as much as a Bullet ſpends a greater time in its fall than its riſe, like darts; or the deſcent is not ſo ſwift, that it ſhould always haſten in that degree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in three or four ſeconds, we have found its ſwiftneſs to be increaſed, which I ſuppoſe to be confirmed from this reaſon, becauſe a bullet deſcending cannot have ſo great a power to ſmite, as it hath aſcending, ſo that approaching the Earth it is not ſo ſwiftly moved, as when it comes from the mouth of the Gun, for when the ſwiftneſs of any thing projected is equall, it equally ſtrikes.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I account Spouts uſeful, ſeeing they bring us to the knowledg of ſhooting, of which otherwiſe we could not judge, by reaſon of the difficulty of trial which is moſt eaſily diſcerned in tubes: for becauſe any one may compare in a little time what ever ſhot he pleaſes with another, to wit, a middle Range <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Former Figure.</hi>
                        </note> with a vertical, or Perpendicular one as to time and height, that this may be the better underſtood, in the following figure let the Cock be A above the Horizon A B, and let the altitude of the tube be A 12, whoſe vertical Squirt is A Φ, Experience teacheth us that the length of the middle Squirt A B, is double to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical A Φ.</p>
                     <p>But to what height the middle Squirt ranges, whether to D or E, which alſo you may underſtand of Bullets ſhot from Guns, there is none hitherto hath obſerved: but it is one half of the vertical Φ A, wherefore the point D or E is higher than it ought to be, and whatever is ſaid by the ingenious, may be corrected by ſpouts.</p>
                     <p>There are other things alſo that want inquiry into; for example, how it can come to paſs, that a bullet ſhot out of the mouth of a Gun from O to P comes right on, when in that time it flying along the line O P a hundred fathoms ought to fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the center of the Earth 12 foot, if the horizontal motion of a thing violently projected hinders not its natural motion, as many imagine in a vacuity or place that does not impede.</p>
                     <p>For although that can partly be explained by the diverſity of the lines, which is ſound in Guns, to wit the line R X Y, which follows the outſide of the Gun, and that which they call <hi>Linea animae</hi> S Z, which paſſes thorough the axis of the hollow M N to the aforeſaid ſide, is in no wiſe parallel: becauſe, to wit, the bullet K or H levelling at L may aſcend to the ſide line I L, or the point S paſſing to Z may aſcend to the point X of the ſide line R Y: yet another thing is to be added, when what is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid is not true, when the eye of the ſhooter takes not aim by the line I L or R X but by the line M N or S X: for then the bullet K does not deſcend ſo much, as it would if it were left to it ſelf in the air.</p>
                     <p>Add, that the water out of the Cock fitted to the Horizontal Squirt doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend ſo much, as it would if left to it ſelf; for it is manifeſt by Experience, that the Horizontal Squirt of 30 foot, which continues two ſeconds, deſcends not ſo much as eight foot, when according to the law of bodies of equal weight, it ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, or at leaſt by reaſon of the reſiſtance of the air breaking the water it ought to deſcord 30 foot.</p>
